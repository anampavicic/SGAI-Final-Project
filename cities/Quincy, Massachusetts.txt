'''Quincy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɪ|n|z|i}} {{respell|KWIN|zee}}) is a city in [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts]], United States. It is the largest city in the county. Quincy is part of the [[Greater Boston]] area as one of [[Boston]]'s immediate southern suburbs. Its population in 2020 was 101,636, making it the seventh-largest city in the [[U.S. state|state]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://donahue.umass.edu/business-groups/economic-public-policy-research/massachusetts-population-estimates-program/census-2020-data-for-massachusetts |title=Census 2020 Data for Massachusetts |publisher=University of Massachusetts Donahue Institute |access-date=September 18, 2021 |archive-date=September 16, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210916095054/https://donahue.umass.edu/business-groups/economic-public-policy-research/massachusetts-population-estimates-program/census-2020-data-for-massachusetts |url-status=live }}</ref> Known as the “''City of Presidents'',”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.quincyma.gov/visitors/default.htm|title=Quincy, MA - Visitors|access-date=February 29, 2020|archive-date=February 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229000056/https://www.quincyma.gov/visitors/default.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> Quincy is the birthplace of two [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] — [[John Adams]] and his son [[John Quincy Adams]] — as well as [[John Hancock]], the first signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the first and third governor of Massachusetts.

First settled in 1625, Quincy was briefly part of [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] before becoming the North Precinct of [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]] in 1640. In 1792, Quincy was split off from the Town of Braintree and was incorporated separately as the Town of Quincy; the new town was named after Colonel [[John Quincy]], maternal grandfather of [[Abigail Adams]] and after whom John Quincy Adams was also named.<ref name="herring">{{cite book |last=Herring |first=James |author2=Longacre, James Barton |title=The National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans |publisher=D.

For over a century, Quincy was home to a thriving [[Granite Quarry|granite quarrying]] industry; the city was also the site of the [[Granite Railway]], the United States' first commercial railroad. Shipbuilding at the [[Fore River Shipyard]] was another key contributor to the city's economy. In the 20th century, both [[Howard Johnson's]] and [[Dunkin' Donuts]] were founded in the city.

[[Massachusett]] [[sachem]] [[Chickatawbut]] had his seat on a hill called [[Moswetuset Hummock]] prior to the settlement of the area by English colonists, situated east of the mouth of the [[Neponset River]] near what is now called [[Squantum]].<ref name="tcpl-hummock">{{cite web|url=http://thomascranelibrary.org/htm/436.htm|title=East Squantum Street (Moswetuset Hummock)|year=1986|work=Quincy, Massa.

Four years later, a party led by Captain [[Richard Wollaston]] established [[Merrymount Colony|a post on a low hill]] near the south shore of [[Quincy Bay]] east of present-day Black's Creek. The settlers found the area suitable for farming, as Chickatawbut and his group had cleared much of the land of trees. (The Indians used the name Passonagessit ("Little Neck of Land") for the area.<ref name="enotes">{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/literary-criticism/morton-thomas|title=Morton, Thomas – Introduction.|last=Schoenberg|first=Thomas J.|year=2006|work=Literary Criticism (1400–1800)|publisher=enotes.com|access-date=2009-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111034857/http://www.enotes.com/literary-criticism/morton-thomas|archive-date=2010-01-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>) This settlement was named Mount Wollaston in honor of the leader, who left the area soon after 1625, bound for [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]].<ref name="lodge-wollaston">{{cite book|last=Lodge|first=Henry Cabot|title=Boston|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|location=New York|year=1902|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_PnFx61kbyxsC/page/n21 7]|oclc=4276118|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_PnFx61kbyxsC|access-date=2009-10-15}}</ref>

The [[Wollaston (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Wollaston]] neighborhood in Quincy still retains Captain Wollaston's name. Upon the departure of Wollaston, [[Thomas Morton (colonist)|Thomas Morton]] took over leadership of the post. Morton's history of conflict with the Plymouth settlement and his free-thinking ideals antagonized the Plymouth settlement, who maligned the colony and accused it of  [[:wikt:debauchery|debauchery]] with Indian women and [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]].<ref name="lodge-wollaston" /> Morton renamed the settlement Ma-re-Mount ("Hill by the Sea") and later wrote that the conservative [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|separatists]] of [[Plymouth Colony]] to the south were "threatening to make it a woefull mount and not a merry mount", in reference to the fact that they disapproved of his [[libertine]] practices.<ref name="morton">{{cite book|last=Morton|first=Thomas|title=The new English Canaan of Thomas Morton|editor=[[Charles Francis Adams, Jr.]]|publisher=The Prince Society|location=[[Boston]]|year=1883|page=[https://archive.org/details/newenglishcanaa00adamgoog/page/n290 278]|oclc=28272732|url=https://archive.org/details/newenglishcanaa00adamgoog|access-date=2009-10-15}}</ref> In 1627, Morton was arrested by Standish for violating the code of conduct in a way harmful to the colony.

Among the city's several firsts was the [[Granite Railway]], the first commercial railroad in the United States. It was constructed in 1826 to carry [[granite]] from a [[Quincy Quarries Reservation|Quincy quarry]] to the [[Neponset River]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]] so that the stone could then be taken by boat to erect the [[Bunker Hill Monument]] in Charlestown. Quincy granite became famous throughout the nation, and [[stonemasonry|stonecutting]] became the city's principal economic activity. Quincy was also home to the first iron furnace in the United States, the [[John Winthrop Jr. Iron Furnace Site]] (also known as Braintree Furnace), from 1644 to 1653.

In the 1870s, the city gave its name to the [[Quincy Method]], an influential approach to education developed by [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis W. Parker]] while he served as Quincy's [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent of schools]]. Parker, an early proponent of [[progressive education]], put his ideas into practice in the city's underperforming schools; four years later, a state survey found that Quincy's students were excelling.<ref name="216.239.59.132">Koegel, R.

Quincy was additionally important as a [[shipbuilding]] center. Sailing ships were built in Quincy for many years, including the only seven-masted [[schooner]] ever built, [[Thomas W. Lawson (ship)|''Thomas W. Lawson'']]. The [[Fore River (Massachusetts)|Fore River]] area became a shipbuilding center in the 1880s; founded by [[Thomas A. Watson]], who became wealthy as assistant to [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in developing the telephone, many famous warships were built at the [[Fore River Shipyard]]. Amongst these were the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Lexington|CV-2}}; the [[battleship]]s {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-59}}, now preserved as a [[museum ship]] at [[Battleship Cove]] in Massachusetts, and {{USS|Nevada|BB-36}}; and {{USS|Salem|CA-139}}, the world's last all-gun heavy warship, which is still preserved at Fore River as the main exhibit of the [[United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum]].

Quincy was also an [[aviation]] pioneer thanks to Dennison Field. Located in the [[Squantum]] section of town it was one of the world's first airports and was partially developed by [[Amelia Earhart]]. In 1910, it was the site of the [[Harvard Aero Meet]], the second air show in America. It was later leased to the [[United States Navy|Navy]] for an airfield, and served as a reserve [[Naval Air Station Squantum|Squantum Naval Air Station]] into the 1950s. The Army has also long maintained a presence in the city, with the [[Massachusetts National Guard|Massachusetts Army National Guard]] occupying the Kelley Armory in Wollaston, from 1971 to 1976 it served as headquarters for the [[187th Infantry Brigade (United States)|187th Infantry Brigade]].

The [[Howard Johnson's]] and [[Dunkin' Donuts]] restaurant chains were both founded in Quincy. [[Celtic punk]] band [[Dropkick Murphys]] got its start in the city's [[Wollaston (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Wollaston]] neighborhood in 1996. Quincy is also home to the United States' longest-running [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]] parade, a tradition that began in 1952 under Richard Koch, a former director of Parks and Recreation, who started the "Koch Club" sports organization for kids and had an annual parade with flags.<ref>Conkley, D.

Quincy has a [[Mayor–council government#Strong-mayor form|strong mayor government]]. The incumbent mayor, [[Thomas P. Koch]], has served since 2008; he is the [[List of mayors of Quincy, Massachusetts|33rd mayor of the city]]. Mayors in the city were elected to two-year terms. In 2013, the city's voters opted to extend the mayoral term to four years, beginning after the 2015 election.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ronan|first1=Patrick|title=Quincy voters double length of mayor's term|url=http://www.patriotledger.com/article/20131106/News/311069396|access-date=December 31, 2014|date=November 6, 2013|work=The Patriot Ledger|archive-date=December 31, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231080521/http://www.patriotledger.com/article/20131106/News/311069396|url-status=live}}</ref>

In addition to the mayor, the city has a nine-member city council, with Ian Cain serving as president as of 2024.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dumcius|first=Gintautas|date=December 6, 2023|url=https://commonwealthbeacon.org/politics/hell-make-a-mark-as-quincys-black-gay-city-council-president-but-dont-ask-him-about-it/|title=He'll make a mark as Quincy's Black, gay city council president – but don't ask him about it|website=CommonWealth Beacon|access-date=2024-06-18}}</ref> Six councilors are elected to represent Quincy's wards, and three are elected at large.

The city also has a school committee with seven members—the mayor and six members elected to staggered four-year terms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.quincyma.gov/Government/CITYCOUNCIL/Councilor.cfm|title=City of Quincy - City Councilor Information|website=www.quincyma.gov|access-date=2016-03-04|archive-date=January 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126011021/http://www.quincyma.gov/Government/CITYCOUNCIL/Councilor.cfm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Public safety====
The Quincy Police Department was formed in 1888, currently headquartered at the original [[Quincy Police Station]] which was built in 1925 as the city's first purpose-built [[police station]] and added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1990. In 2010, the city of Quincy was the first in the US to have its police department carry the nasal spray [[Narcan]] (Nalaxone) to combat the overdose outbreak associated with the [[Opioid epidemic in the United States|opioid epidemic in the US]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Humphreys |first1=Keith |title=An overdose antidote goes mainstream |journal=Health Affairs |date=October 2015 |volume=34 |issue=10 |pages=1624–1627 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0934 |publisher=Project Hope |location=Bethesda MD|pmid=26438736 |doi-access= }}</ref> When the program first began, the city's officers were reviving an overdose victim every four to five days. By 2014, police officers had administered the opioid antagonist over 300 times. Other cities and police departments throughout the US developed their own Narcan-dispensing programs based on the model pioneered by the Quincy PD.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ronan |first1=Patrick |title=Quincy police successfully use Narcan for 300th time |url=https://www.patriotledger.com/article/20141008/NEWS/141006435 |work=The Patriot-Ledger |publisher=Gannett |date=8 October 2014 |location=Quincy MA |access-date=March 31, 2020 |archive-date=July 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200703022521/https://www.patriotledger.com/article/20141008/News/141006435 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2017, overdose deaths in the city and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had declined, it was thought, due to the use of naloxone by the police and others. The state legislature, in 2018, required all pharmacies to keep Narcan in stock and available to anyone, without a prescription.<ref>{{cite news |last1=DiFazio |first1=Joe |last2=Simpson |first2=Neal |title=As opioids ravage the nation, Massachusetts cautiously turns a corner |url=https://www.patriotledger.com/news/20190112/as-opioids-ravage-nation-massachusetts-cautiously-turns-corner |work=The Patriot-Ledger |publisher=Gannett |date=16 January 2019 |location=Quincy MA |access-date=March 31, 2020 |archive-date=August 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806155251/https://www.patriotledger.com/news/20190112/as-opioids-ravage-nation-massachusetts-cautiously-turns-corner |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Education==
[[Image:MunrohallENC.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Munro Hall on the Eastern Nazarene College main campus]]
Quincy is home to various educational institutions, public and private, including one [[early childhood education]] center, one [[Montessori education|Montessori school]], one [[Catholic school]], one [[college-preparatory school]], two colleges, [[Eastern Nazarene College]], a private liberal arts and sciences college, and [[Quincy College]], a public, localized college, two public [[Secondary school|high schools]], five public [[middle school]]s, and 12 public [[elementary school]]s. In the 19th century, the city became an innovator in progressive public education with the [[Quincy Method]], developed by [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis W. Parker]] while he served as Quincy's [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent of schools]]. Four years after its implementation, a state survey found that Quincy students excelled at reading, writing, and spelling, and ranked fourth in their county in math.<ref name="216.239.59.132"/>

===Higher education===
The city is home to [[Eastern Nazarene College]], a college of the liberal arts and sciences located in [[Wollaston (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Wollaston Park]]. The college relocated to the area in 1919 from its original location in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], where it was established as a [[Holiness movement|holiness]] college in 1900. [[Quincy College]], a [[community college]] in [[Quincy Center]], operates under the auspices of the City of Quincy. The college is unusual in this respect, as it is the only one of Massachusetts' 16 community colleges to be run by a city rather than by the [[U.S. state|state]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/12/23/menino_targeting_community_colleges/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Matt | last=Viser | title=Menino targeting community colleges | date=2006-12-23 | access-date=December 25, 2010 | archive-date=May 22, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522165223/http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/12/23/menino_targeting_community_colleges/ | url-status=live }}</ref> It is one of only two colleges in the United States organized this way.<ref name="gratz">{{Cite web |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED426752 |title=Donald B.

Quincy is also home to the Massachusetts School of Barbering.

===Public libraries===
The [[Thomas Crane Public Library]] serves as the public library system of Quincy, Massachusetts.

===Supplementary education===
Peter Jae established the Quincy Chinese Language School, which offers supplementary education for Chinese children, in 1988. As of 2003 it holds [[Cantonese]]-language classes for 150 students at the Sacred Heart School in North Quincy on Saturday mornings. The school at one time had 400 students but the school reduced itself in size when a lack of qualified teachers occurred.<ref name=hsiaoWeekend/>

The Chung Yee School is another Chinese school in Quincy. As of 2008 the headmaster is Harry Kwan, who originated from Hong Kong. That year the school had 100 students and charged $100 (${{inflation|USD|100|2008|r=2}} adjusted for inflation) per child per month for Chinese language and culture after school classes. It was first established around 1996.<!--12 years of operation - subtract that from 2008 and you get 1996--> The school was briefly closed by the Quincy Police Department on November 28, 2008, due to a lack of Massachusetts state and local government permits. After the state and municipal authorities cleared the school of allegations of child abuse, it was scheduled to reopen that year.<ref>Mann, Jennifer.

After the allegation, Chung Yee School continued to operate without obtaining a government childcare license for after-school programs.

In December 2002 the Vrindavana Preservation Society established the Vaisnava Academy which caters to Quincy's East Indian community and offers courses for children. Subjects include the [[Hindi]] language, Indian dance and music, and yoga.<ref name=EschbacherIndian/>

==Transportation==
[[Image:QuincyPresidents.jpg|thumb|right|250px|City of Presidents banner previously displayed on Route 3A. The temporary Fore River Bridge can be seen in the background.]]
As part of [[Greater Boston|Metro Boston]], Quincy has easy access to transportation facilities. State highways and the Interstate system connect the [[Greater Boston]] area to the airport, port, and intermodal facilities of [[Boston]]. Due to its proximity to Boston proper, Quincy is connected not only by these modes of transportation but also to the regional [[Rapid transit|subway]] system, operated by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA), known locally as "The T". The four subway or "T" stops in Quincy, which are on the MBTA's [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]], are [[North Quincy (MBTA station)|North Quincy Station]], [[Wollaston (MBTA station)|Wollaston Station]], [[Quincy Center (MBTA station)|Quincy Center Station]], and [[Quincy Adams (MBTA station)|Quincy Adams Station]].

===Highways and roads===
[[Interstate 93]] and [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] travel south to north concurrently through Quincy beginning in the southwest, where the Quincy–Randolph border bisects the median between the northern and southern halves of the Exit 5 cloverleaf at Massachusetts Route 28. Following a route around the southern extent of the [[Blue Hills Reservation]], this I-93 and US 1 alignment is along the former southern section of [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]. The highway travels along a wooded wetland region of the Reservation, entering Quincy completely just beyond Exit 5 and then crossing into Braintree as it approaches the [[Braintree Split]], the junction with [[Massachusetts Route 3]]. Weekday traffic volume averages 250,000 to 275,000 vehicles per day at this intersection, the gateway from Boston and its inner core to the [[South Shore (Massachusetts)|South Shore]] and [[Cape Cod]].<ref name="MPO">[http://www.bostonmpo.org/bostonmpo/4_resources/1_reports/1_studies/2_highway/braintree_split/braintree_split_p1.pdf "I-93/Southeast Expressway/Route 3 (Braintree Split): ''Operational Assessment and Potential Improvements''"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919034303/http://www.bostonmpo.org/bostonmpo/4_resources/1_reports/1_studies/2_highway/braintree_split/braintree_split_p1.pdf |date=2010-09-19 }} Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization, March 2006, p. 3.</ref>

As Route 3 joins I-93 and US 1 at the Braintree Split, the three travel north together toward Boston around the eastern extent of the Blue Hills Reservation, entering [[West Quincy (Quincy, Massachusetts)|West Quincy]] as the [[Southeast Expressway (Boston)|Southeast Expressway]]. The expressway provides access to West Quincy at Exit 8—[[Furnace Brook Parkway]] and Exit 9—Bryant Avenue/Adams Street before entering Milton. The Furnace Brook Parkway exit also provides access to Ricciuti Drive and the [[Quincy Quarries Reservation]] as well as the eastern entrance to the [[Blue Hills Reservation Parkways]].

Principal numbered state highways traveling within Quincy include: [[Massachusetts Route 3A|Route 3A]] south to north from Weymouth via Washington Street, [[Southern Artery]], Merrymount Parkway and Hancock Street to the Neponset River Bridge and the [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] section of Boston; [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]], which travels south to north from Randolph to Milton along Randolph Avenue in Quincy through a remote section of the Blue Hills Reservation; and [[Massachusetts Route 53|Route 53]], which enters traveling south to north from Braintree as Quincy Avenue, turning right to form the beginning of Southern Artery in [[Quincy Point (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Quincy Point]] before ending at the intersection with Washington Street/Route 3A.

[[Image:Quincycenter.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Quincy Center as seen from the intersection of Adams Street and Hancock Street]]
In addition to the Blue Hills [[parkway]]s, Quincy includes two other [[Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]] parkways. [[Furnace Brook Parkway]] travels east from I-93 through the center of the city from West Quincy to [[Quincy Center (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Quincy Center]] and [[Merrymount (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Merrymount]] at [[Quincy Bay]]. There the parkway meets [[Quincy Shore Drive]] at the mouth of Blacks Creek. Quincy Shore Drive travels in a northerly direction along the shore of Quincy Bay through [[Wollaston (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Wollaston]] and into [[North Quincy (Quincy, Massachusetts)|North Quincy]], with much of its length abutting [[Wollaston Beach]], then turns in a westerly direction upon intersecting with East Squantum Street and continues to meet Hancock Street at the Neponset River Bridge.

As for Quincy's other important city streets, Hancock Street begins at the southern extent of Quincy Center as a continuation of Quincy Avenue and travels north to Dorchester as a main commercial thoroughfare of Quincy Center, Wollaston and North Quincy. Washington Street enters the city at Fore River Rotary after crossing [[Weymouth Fore River]] via the [[Fore River Bridge]] and continues to Quincy Center, ending at Hancock Street. Along with Quincy Avenue and Southern Artery, other heavily traveled streets include Newport Avenue, which parallels Hancock Street to the west on the opposite side of the MBTA railway, Adams Street heading west from Quincy Center to Milton, and West and East Squantum Streets in the [[Montclair (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Montclair]] and North Quincy neighborhoods. Other streets are discussed in several of the neighborhood articles listed above.

===Airport===
Boston's [[Logan International Airport]] is accessible via MBTA Red Line connections at [[South Station]], directly on the MBTA commuter boat (see below) or by motor vehicle using [[Interstate 93]] or surface roads to the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]].

===MBTA rail and other commuter services===
Subway service is available on the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] of the MBTA from four stations in Quincy: [[North Quincy station|North Quincy]], [[Wollaston station|Wollaston]], [[Quincy Center station|Quincy Center]], and [[Quincy Adams station|Quincy Adams]]. Commuter rail service operates out of Quincy Center. Both services serve [[South Station]] in Boston with connections to [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] and [[Amtrak]] intercity lines. Buses are also available for transportation in Quincy, including private bus lines and several lines provided by the MBTA. Most of the MBTA routes funnel through the Quincy Center station, which is the principal hub south of Boston for all MBTA bus lines. The southern bus garage for the MBTA system is adjacent to the Quincy Armory on Hancock Street.

Quincy was a major terminal for the [[MBTA boat|commuter boat]] system that crosses [[Boston Harbor]] to [[Long Wharf (Boston)|Long Wharf]], [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]], [[Rowe's Wharf]], [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], and [[Logan Airport]]. The commuter boats, which were operated by Harbor Express under license by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]], docked at the [[Fore River Shipyard]] in [[Quincy Point]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.harborexpress.com/ |title=Harbor Express website |access-date=2020-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980630011246/http://www.harborexpress.com/ |archive-date=1998-06-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Service ended in October 2013 after a water main break damaged the sea wall and wharf. Temporary repairs would have cost $15 million; permanent repairs $50 million. In 2014, the MBTA made the decision to permanently end the service and sell the land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/south/2014/03/12/mbta-cancels-quincy-ferry-service-and-plans-sell-terminal-and-wharf/UVzGSqEszLrItEdkKmqXBI/story.html|title=T says Quincy ferry service done - the Boston Globe|website=[[The Boston Globe]]|access-date=September 1, 2015|archive-date=September 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924130637/http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/south/2014/03/12/mbta-cancels-quincy-ferry-service-and-plans-sell-terminal-and-wharf/UVzGSqEszLrItEdkKmqXBI/story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Sports ==

Quincy has had brief flirtations with professional sports.

Quincy has had several [[American football|football]] teams in the semi-pro Eastern Football League over the years. The current club, the Quincy Militia, played its inaugural season in the EFL in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.patriotledger.com/sports/x387871853/Semi-pro-Quincy-football-team-is-not-playing-like-an-EFL-expansion-team|title=Semi-pro Quincy football team is not playing like an EFL expansion team|last=McHugh|first=Patrick|date=August 20, 2009|newspaper=The Patriot Ledger|access-date=28 November 2009|location=Quincy, Massachusetts|archive-date=March 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315062518/http://www.patriotledger.com/sports/x387871853/Semi-pro-Quincy-football-team-is-not-playing-like-an-EFL-expansion-team|url-status=live}}</ref> Founded in 2009 by long-time Quincy resident Vaughn Driscoll, new owners came into the team picture in 2013. Militia games are played July to October with home games at Veterans Memorial Stadium on Saturday nights. An earlier team, the Quincy Giants, played in the minor league [[Atlantic Coast Football League]] between 1969 and 1971.
