It is also the administrative center of the Syktyvkar Urban Okrug. Until 1930, it was known as '''Ust-Sysolsk''', after the [[Sysola|Sysola River]].{{Historical populations|1897|4464|1926|5068|1939|25281|1959|64461|1970|125088|1979|170980|1989|232117|2002|230011|2010|235006|2021|220580|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}

==Etymology==
The city's name comes from ''Syktyv'', the [[Komi language|Komi]] name for the [[Sysola River]], and ''kar'', meaning "city" in the [[Komi language|Komi]] Language.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

==Geography==
Syktyvkar is located on the Sysola River, which is the origin of its former name Ust-Sysolsk. The city is located close to where the Sysola joins the larger [[Vychegda River]], which is itself a branch of the [[Northern Dvina]].{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

It is believed that the city was founded in 1586 as a settlement '''Ust-Sysola'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://xn----etbdra6aacodma.xn--p1ai/syktyvkar|title=Syktyvkar - Russian cities (Russian)|website=City of Russia - National selection|access-date=March 10, 2020|archive-date=December 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203141852/http://xn----etbdra6aacodma.xn--p1ai/syktyvkar|url-status=live}}</ref>

It was granted city status by [[Catherine the Great]] in 1780, and in 1992, it became the capital of the Komi Republic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oldsyktyvkar.ru/?page_id=12|title=History in dates - old Syktyvkar (Russian)|website=Old Syktyvkar|access-date=March 10, 2020|archive-date=January 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200108203748/http://oldsyktyvkar.ru/?page_id=12|url-status=live}}</ref> It has remained the capital since then, although a large influx of ethnic Russians in the 20th century has actually left the Komi a minority there.

The majority of the population were merchants and peasants. The main occupations of the inhabitants were agriculture, cattle-breeding, hunting, fishing, and trade.

By the beginning of the 20th century, the population had grown to 6,000 people. The Tsarist government made the Komi region a place of political exile.

In 1921, Ust-Sysolsk was given the status of administrative center of the newly formed [[Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast]]. It was renamed as Syktyvkar, which is Komi for "a town on the Sysola" in 1930, to mark the 150th anniversary of its receipt of city privileges. In 1936, Syktyvkar became the capital of the [[Komi ASSR]].

==Administrative and municipal status==
Syktyvkar is the [[capital city|capital]] of the republic.<ref name="Ref58">Law #16-RZ</ref> Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with three [[urban-type settlement]]s ([[Krasnozatonsky]], [[Sedkyrkeshch]], and [[Verkhnyaya Maksakovka]]) and three [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated as the [[city of federal subject significance|city of republic significance]] of Syktyvkar—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of the Komi Republic|districts]].<ref name="Ref58" /> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of republic significance of Syktyvkar is incorporated as Syktyvkar Urban Okrug.<ref name="Ref747">Law #11-RZ</ref>

==Economy==
