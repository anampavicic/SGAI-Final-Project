</ref> It serves as the capital of the [[Morogoro Region]]. Informally, it is referred to as ''<span lang="Sw" dir="ltr">Mji kasoro bahari</span>'', which translates to ''city short of an ocean/port.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/magazine/morogoro-city-with-no-ocean-making-waves-in-hospitality-3837516|title=Amani Home|website=city short of an ocean}}</ref>

In Morogoro, the non-profit organization [[APOPO]] trains [[Gambian pouched rat]]s known as [[HeroRATS]], for [[landmine]] detection as well as the detection of [[tuberculosis]]. Notably, the [[Sokoine University of Agriculture]] is based in Morogoro. The city is also home to various missions that provide educational and medical facilities, benefiting the local community.

==Mindu Dam==

The Mindu Dam, situated on the [[Ngerengere River]], stands as the primary water source for Morogoro, meeting approximately 80% of the city's water demands. Despite its critical role, the dam has been a focal point of controversy since its inception in 1978. The formation of a reservoir behind the dam has led to a surge in bilharzia infection rates,<ref>[http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-4832-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html IRDC Archive: The Essential Health Interventions Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504122117/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-4832-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |date=2007-05-04 }}</ref> while the city's water supply has suffered pollution from mercury runoff originating from nearby gold mining activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipp.co.tz/ipp/guardian/2004/07/14/15820.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050116202614/http://www.ipp.co.tz/ipp/guardian/2004/07/14/15820.html|url-status=dead|title=Mindu destruction setting stage for a catastrophe<!-- Bot generated title -->|archive-date=January 16, 2005}}</ref> Furthermore, deforestation in the dam's vicinity has accelerated sedimentation, adversely affecting its capacity.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/9342|title=Water for Everyone |first1=Celina |last1=Smith |first2=Marije |last2=Schaafsma |first3=Philip |last3=Platts |first4=Shadrack |last4=Mwakalila |first5=Sue |last5=White |first6=Biniam |last6=Ashagre |journal=The Arc Journal |date=June 22, 2014 |hdl=1826/9342 |via=dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk}}</ref>

In an effort to mitigate these challenges, a program funded by USAID/MCC, with a budget of $8.31 million, was initiated in 2012–13. The program's objective was to restore the quality of drinking water resources from the Uluguru Mountains by establishing an inlet and treatment plant near the Regional Governance offices at the upper end of Boma Road. This initiative aimed to benefit the Morogoro Water Supply Authority (MORUWASA) by enhancing the quality and availability of water resources.
