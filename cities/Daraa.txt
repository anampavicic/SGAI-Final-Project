It is the capital of [[Daraa Governorate]] in the [[Hauran]] region. The city is located about {{convert|90|km}} south of [[Damascus]] on the Damascus–Amman highway, and is used as a stopping station for travelers.

==History==

===Ancient history===
Daraa is an ancient city dating back to the [[Canaanites]]. It was mentioned in Egyptian hieroglyphic tablets at the time of the Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] between 1490 and 1436 BC. It was known in those days as the city of Atharaa. It was later referred to in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as Edrei or Edre'i (אֶדְרֶעִי),<ref name="Deuteronomy">Numbers 21:33 and Deuteronomy 3:1</ref> the capital of [[Bashan]], site of a battle where the [[Israelites]] defeated the city's king, [[Og]].<ref name="Negev">Negev, p. 150.</ref> According to Jewish tradition, [[Eldad and Medad]] were buried in Edrei.<ref>''Burial Places of the Fathers'', published by Yehuda Levi Nahum in book: ''Ṣohar la-ḥasifat ginzei teiman'' (Heb. '''צהר לחשיפת גנזי תימן'''), Tel-Aviv 1986, p. 253 {{OCLC|15417732}}</ref>

===Classical era===
In the Greek [[Seleucid Empire]], and later the [[Roman Empire]] into which it was incorporated by Emperor [[Trajan]] in 106, the city was known as Adraa (Ἀδράα),<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0064%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DA%3Aentry+group%3D3%3Aentry%3Dadraa-geo William Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography'' (1864): Adraa]</ref> the name used on its coinage.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xs8GAwAAQBAJ&q=Adraa+Arabia|title=Catalogue of the Greek coins in The British Museum|year=2004|isbn=9785872102076}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snible.org/coins/hn/arabia.html|title=Ancient coins of Arabia|work=snible.org}}</ref> It was incorporated into the province of [[Arabia Petraea]].<ref name="Sharon68">Sharon, 2007, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1d8xHcor0psC&pg=PA68  68]</ref> 

By the 3rd century, it gained the status of a ''[[polis]]'' (self-governed city). Roman historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] referred to it by Adraa, calling it a famous ''polis'' of Arabia.<ref name="Negev"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IA-YlZqHv90C&dq=Eusebius+Adraa&pg=PA419 Fergus Millar, ''The Roman Near East, 31 B.C.-A.D. 337''] (Harvard University Press 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-67477886-3}}), p. 419</ref> The area east of Adraa was a centre of the [[Ebionites]].<ref>[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rak/courses/535/Harnack/bk4ch3-1n.htm Adolf Harnack, ''The Mission and Expansion of Christianity in the First Three Centuries'', Book 4, Chapter 3, section 1]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zs43AAAAIAAJ&dq=Adraa+Ebionites&pg=PA29 Albertus Frederik Johannes Klijn, G. J. Reinink, ''Patristic Evidence for Jewish-Christian Sects''] (Brill Archive 1973 {{ISBN|978-9-00403763-2}}), p. 29</ref> Adraa itself was a Christian [[bishopric]]. Arabio, the first bishop of Adraa whose name is known, participated in the [[Council of Seleucia]] of 359. Uranius was at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381; Proclus at the anti-[[Eutyches]] synod of Constantinople in 448 and the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451; and Dorimenius at the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in 553.<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_86weAemI-e4C ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 859-860</ref><ref>Siméon Vailhé, v.

In 614, the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian Persians]] sacked Adraa during the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], but spared the inhabitants.<ref name="Sharon68"/>

===Islamic era===
According to [[Ibn Hisham]] and [[al-Waqidi]], 9th-century biographers of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], the Jewish [[Banu Nadir]] and [[Banu Qaynuqa]] tribes immigrated to Adhri'at, as it was known in the early Islamic period, following their expulsion from [[Medina]]. However, historian [[Moshe Sharon]] dismisses this, citing the absence of their claims in any Jewish sources and earlier Muslim reports.<ref name="Sharon68"/> Situated between the major Jewish centres of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Babylonia]], Adhri'at nonetheless had a large Jewish population by the early 7th century and served as a place of Jewish learning. Its residents lit an annual bonfire on [[Rosh Hashannah]] in a signal to Babylonia's Jewish communities that the religious new year had begun.<ref name="Sharon68"/>

Early Muslim historian [[al-Baladuri]] lists Adhri'at as one of the towns which surrendered to the Muslim army following the [[Battle of Mu'ta]] in 629, while Muhammad was alive. Consequently, the inhabitants paid [[jizya]] tax.<ref name="Sharon69"/> Baladhuri's account was believed to have been a mistake. Instead, contemporary sources maintain that Adhri'at was conquered by the [[Rashidun army|Muslim army]] during the [[caliphate]] of [[Abu Bakr]] in 634.<ref>Houtma, 1993, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GEl6N2tQeawC&pg=PA135 135]</ref> Adhri'at's residents reportedly celebrated the arrival of the second caliph [[Umar]] when he visited the city, "dancing with swords and sweet basil."<ref name="Sharon69">Sharon, 2007, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1d8xHcor0psC&pg=PA69 69]</ref> Throughout [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] rule, the city served as the capital of the al-Bathaniyya subdistrict, part of the larger [[Jund Dimashq]] ("military district of Damascus.")<ref>le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/34/mode/1up 34]</ref>

In 906, the population was massacred in a raid by the rebellious [[Qarmatians]].<ref name="Sharon69"/> The late 10th-century geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] noted that during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] period, Adhri'at was a major administrative center on the edge of the desert.<ref name="Strange383">le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/383/mode/1up 383]</ref> He claimed the city was part of the [[Jund al-Urdunn]] district and that its territory was "full of villages" and included the region of [[Jerash]] to the south of the [[Yarmouk River]].<ref name="Strange383"/><ref>le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/40/mode/1up 40]</ref>

Throughout the early Islamic period, it served as a strategic station on the [[Hajj]] caravan route between [[Damascus]] and [[Medina]] and as the gate to central Syria. The [[Crusades|Crusader]]s temporarily conquered Adhri'at, then known as ''Adratum'',<ref name="Sharon70"/> during the reign of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] in 1118.{{sfn|Runciman|1989|p=146}}

According to [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], in the early 13th-century during [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] rule, Adhri'at was "celebrated for the many learned men who were natives of the place."<ref name="Strange383"/> Under the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]]s and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s, the city maintained its importance.<ref name="Sharon70">Sharon, 2007, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1d8xHcor0psC&pg=PA70  70]</ref> In 1596 Daraa appeared in the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman]] tax registers as '
Madinat Idra'a' and was part of the ''[[nahiya]]'' of Butayna (Bathaniyya) in the [[Hauran Sanjak]]. It had a Muslim population of 120 households and 45 bachelors.  A 40% tax−rate was levied  on wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and/or beehives; a total of 26,500 [[akçe]].<ref>Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 214.</ref>

In 1838, [[Eli Smith]] listed Daraa  as a Muslim, Catholic and Greek Orthodox village in the Nuqrah (southern Hauran plain), south of [[Al-Shaykh Maskin|Eshmiskin]].<ref name=Smith151>[[Eli Smith|Smith]]; in Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Second appendix, B, p. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearch03robiuoft#page/152/mode/1up 152].</ref>

===Modern era===
Following the Ottomans' construction of the [[Hejaz Railway]], it became a chief junction of the railroad. In both his book ''Seven Pillars'' and a 1919 letter to a military colleague,<ref>Letter to W.F. Stirling, Deputy Chief Political Officer, Cairo, 28 June 1919, in Brown, 1988.</ref> [[T. E. Lawrence]] describes an episode on 20 November 1917 while reconnoitering Deraa in disguise when he was captured by the Ottoman military, heavily beaten, and sexually abused by the local [[Bey]] and his guardsmen. During the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]], Lawrence led the [[Arab Revolt]] in cutting the southern rail line at [[Mafraq]], the northern at [[Tell Arar]], and the western by [[Mezerib]].<ref name="TE">{{cite book |last1=Lawrence |first1=T.E. |title=Seven Pillars of Wisdom |date=1935 |publisher=Doubleday, Doran & Company, Inc. |location=Garden City |pages=580–583,635}}</ref><ref name="Neil">{{cite book |last1=Faulkner |first1=Neil |title=Lawrence of Arabia's War: The Arabs, the British and the Remaking of the Middle East in WWI |date=2016 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=9780300226393 |page=427-429}}</ref> On 27 September 1918, the [[Sharifian Army|Arab Northern Army]] [[Battle of Daraa (1918)|captured Daraa]] from the retreating Ottoman forces.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arabrevolt.jo/en/milestones-list/revolt-s-military-routes-in-jordan-and-syria/ |title=Revolt's Military Routes in Jordan and Syria |website=arabrevolt.jo }}</ref>

Daraa is the southernmost city of Syria near the border with [[Jordan]] and a major midpoint between Damascus and [[Amman]].<ref name="Sharon70"/>

After the Syrian [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'ath Party]] gained power following the [[1963 Syrian coup d'état|1963 coup]], the new interior minister [[Amin al-Hafiz]] appointed Abd al-Rahman al-Khlayfawi as governor of Daraa until 1965.<ref>Moubayed, 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&pg=PA275 275]</ref>
Daraa had recently, before the [[Syrian Civil War]], suffered from reduced water supply in the region and had been straining under the influx of internal refugees who were forced to leave their northeastern lands due to a drought exacerbated by the government's lack of provision.<ref>{{cite news|work=n+1|author=Michael Gunning|date=26 August 2011|url=http://nplusonemag.com/background-to-a-revolution|title=Background to a Revolution}}</ref>

Daraa played an important role by the start of the [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|2011 uprising]] against the government led by [[President of Syria|President]] [[Bashar al-Assad]] as part of the [[Arab Spring]] protests with hundreds of thousands of people protesting in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Syria to free child prisoners|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=20 Mar 2011|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/2011320113138901721.html|access-date=20 Mar 2011}}</ref> The uprising was sparked on 6 March 2011, when at least 15 youths were arrested and tortured for scrawling graffiti on their school wall denouncing the Assad government. The family and friends of the detained youths and tens of thousands of locals marched on the streets on 15 March, demanding their release. According to activists, this protest was faced with Syrian security forces opening fire on the protesters killing four people.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12791738 | work=BBC News | title=Middle East unrest: Three killed at protest in Syria | date=18 March 2011}}</ref> Protests continued daily. 

During this time the local courthouse, the Ba'ath party headquarters in the city, and the [[Syriatel]] building owned by [[Rami Makhlouf]], a cousin of President Assad, were set on fire. What followed was a government assault on the city as violence continued and intensified all across Syria. On 25 April 2011, the [[Military of Syria|Syrian military]] [[April–May 2011 Daraa siege|launched a large operation in Daraa]] in a crackdown on protesters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/node/99345/section/5 |title="We've Never Seen Such Horror" &#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=1 June 2011 |access-date=29 August 2013}}</ref> The operation lasted until 5 May 2011, killing and arresting tens of thousands of locals in the process.

On 16 February 2012, the Syrian Army reportedly attacked Daraa, shelling the city heavily. This was apparently because, "Daraa has been regaining its role in the uprising. Demonstrations resumed and the [[Free Syrian Army|FSA]] provided security for protests in some parts of the city." The attack was part of a security force push "to regain control of areas they lost in recent weeks", indicating that the FSA in Daraa had taken control of parts of the city. Security forces attacked at least three districts, but FSA fighters fought back, firing at Syrian Army roadblocks and buildings housing security police and militiamen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/syria-feb-16-2012-0932 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712111242/http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/syria-feb-16-2012-0932 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |title=Syria live blog Thu, 16 Feb 2012, 06:32 |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.net |date=16 February 2012 |access-date=29 August 2013 }}</ref> {{anchor|Al-Balad}} On 14 March 2012, the [[Free Syrian Army|FSA]] controlled at least one main district in the city of Daraa (al-Balad district) prompting the Syrian army to attack it with anti-aircraft guns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/syria-mar-14-2012-1143 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711041628/http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/syria-mar-14-2012-1143 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 11, 2012 |title=Syria - Mar 14, 2012 - 11:43 &#124; Al Jazeera Blogs |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.net |date=14 March 2012 |access-date=20 April 2012 }}</ref>

In early June 2017, much of Daraa was reported to have been destroyed by protracted fighting.<ref>[https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/6/5/syrian-regime-jets-pound-a-day-after-rebel-attacks Syrian regime jets pound Daraa after rebel attacks] TheNewArab, 5 June 2017.</ref> On 12 July 2018, the battle for Daraa ended after several days of intense clashes between the Syrian Army and rebel forces, some of which agreed to terms of reconciliation. The Syrian Army retook the city fully.<ref>{{cite news|title=Breaking: Battle for Daraa city ends in decisive victory for Syrian Army|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/breaking-battle-for-daraa-city-ends-in-decisive-victory-for-syrian-army/|access-date=12 July 2018|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|archive-date=30 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130102846/https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/breaking-battle-for-daraa-city-ends-in-decisive-victory-for-syrian-army/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[2020 Daraa clashes]] and [[2021 Daraa offensive]] ended with Syrian Army victory. After that, the [[Syrian government]] fully recaptured city, reestabilished state institutions there, and restarted reconciliation process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/1/truce-reached-in-syrias-deraa-after-months-of-fighting-reports|title=Truce reached in Syria's Deraa after months of fighting: Reports|website=www.aljazeera.com |date=1 September 2021}}</ref>
