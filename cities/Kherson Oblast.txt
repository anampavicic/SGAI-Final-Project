'''Kherson Oblast''' ({{langx|uk|Херсонська область|translit=Khersonska oblast|link=}}, {{IPA|uk|xerˈsɔnʲsʲkɐ ˈɔblɐsʲtʲ|IPA}}; {{langx|ru|Херсонская область}}), also known as '''Khersonshchyna''' ({{langx|uk|Херсонщина|label=none}}, {{IPA|uk|xerˈsɔnʃtʃɪnɐ|IPA}}), is an [[administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblast]] (province) in southern [[Ukraine]]. It is located just north of [[Crimea]]. Its [[administrative center]] is [[Kherson]], on the northern or [[right bank]] of the [[Dnieper]] river, which bisects the oblast. The oblast has an area of 28,461&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and a population of {{Ua-pop-est2022|1,001,598|punct=.}} It is considered the 'fruit basket' of the country, as much of its agricultural production is dispersed throughout the country, with production peaking during the summer months.

Most of the area of the [[Russian occupation of Kherson Oblast|oblast has been under Russian military occupation]] since early in the 2022 [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]]. On 30 September 2022, Russia claimed to [[Annexation of Southern and Eastern Ukraine|annex]] Kherson Oblast, along with the [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] ([[Donetsk People's Republic]]), [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]] ([[Luhansk People's Republic]]) and [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast|Zaporizhzhia]] oblasts, but the [[2022 annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine|referendums]] and subsequent claimed annexations are internationally unrecognized. Ukraine recaptured the whole area on the right bank of the Dnieper, including Kherson city, by mid-November 2022, in the [[2022 Kherson counteroffensive|Kherson counteroffensive]].

==History==
[[File:Kazykermen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|17th-century view of Kazikermen, now [[Beryslav]]]]

It was the scene of Soviet genocidal crimes, chiefly the [[Holodomor]] of 1932–1933 and part of the [[Katyn massacre]] of 1940.<ref>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=2020|title=Zbrodnia katyńska|language=pl|location=Warszawa|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance|IPN]]|page=17|isbn=978-83-8098-825-5}}</ref> During [[World War II]], it was occupied by Germany from 1941 to 1944.

The province was established in 1944 within [[Soviet Ukraine]].

In the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum]], 90.13% of votes in Kherson Oblast were in favor of the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]].{{r|DT150103}}

A survey conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in December 2014 found that 90.9% of the oblast's population opposed their region joining Russia, 1% supported the idea, and the rest were undecided or did not respond.{{r|DT150103}}<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&cat=reports&id=302&page=1 | title=Press releases and reports – the views and opinions of South-Eastern regions residents of Ukraine: April 2014 }}</ref>

Since the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]] began on 24 February 2022, Russian forces have occupied most of the oblast, with government by the "Kherson military–civilian administration"<ref name="rferlra">{{cite news |title=Russia-Appointed Official In Ukraine Killed In Car Bombing |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/32002332.html |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=24 August 2022}}</ref> from 28 April to 30 September 2022.

On 5 September it was announced that the newly-installed Russian administration had postponed its plans to hold a referendum on the planned secession from Ukraine. The plebiscite had been scheduled to occur on 11 September, in order to coincide with the Russian electoral calendar.

==Geography==
[[File:Kherson Oblast 2020 subdivisions.jpg|thumb|Kherson Oblast and subdivisions since July 2020]]

Kherson Oblast is bordered by [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] to the north, the [[Black Sea]] and [[Crimea]] to the south, [[Mykolaiv Oblast]] to the west, and the [[Azov Sea]] and [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast]] to the east. The [[Dnieper River]], which includes the [[Kakhovka Reservoir]], runs through the oblast.

Before the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], two bridges spanned the Dniper: the Khakovsky Bridge near [[Nova Kakhovka]] and the [[Antonivka Road Bridge]] at Kherson. Another significant bridge, the Daryivka Bridge crosses the [[Inhulets river]] and connects Kherson via the M14 highway to [[Beryslav]], the other abutment of the Khakovsky Bridge.

The oblast's [[Henichesk Raion]] includes the northern portion of the [[Arabat Spit]], a thin strip of land between the brackish [[Syvash]] and the [[Sea of Azov]] that is geographically part of the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. Due to Russia gaining ''de facto'' control of the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] in 2014, this strip within Kherson Oblast was the only part of the Crimean Peninsula under Ukrainian control immediately prior to the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]].{{cn|date=November 2022}}

Historically, it is located in [[Yedisan]] (north-western part), [[Zaporizhzhia (region)|Zaporizhzhia]] (northern part) and [[Pryazovia]] (southern and eastern parts).

[[Kherson]] is the only city with a population over 100,000. Four other cities have over 30,000 – they are, in order from largest, [[Nova Kakhovka]], [[Kakhovka]], [[Oleshky]] and [[Henichesk]].

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|Administrative divisions of Kherson Oblast}}

Until the 2020 re-organisation, the Kherson Oblast was administratively subdivided into 18 ''[[raions]]'' ([[district]]s) and 3 [[municipality|municipalities]]. The municipalities – [[Kherson]] (administrative center of the oblast), [[Nova Kakhovka]], and [[Kakhovka]] – were directly subordinate to the oblast government. The Kherson municipality was subdivided into 3 urban districts.

.* Note: Though the administrative center of the raion is housed in the city/town that it is named after, cities do not answer to the raion authorities only towns do; instead they are directly subordinated to the oblast government and therefore are not counted as part of raion statistics.

At a lower level of administration, these district-level administrations are subdivided into:
* Settlements – 697, including:
** [[Village#Slavic countries|Villages]] – 658; &ndash; ''See [[List of villages in Kherson Oblast]]''
** Cities/Urban-type settlements – 36, including:
*** Cities of raion subordinance – 4 ([[Beryslav]], [[Henichesk]], [[Skadovsk]], [[Tavriisk]], and [[Oleshky]]);
*** [[Urban-type settlement]] – 30;
* [[Selsovet]]s – 260.

The local administration of the oblast is controlled by the Kherson Regional Council. The governor of the oblast is the Kherson Regional Council speaker, appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]].
