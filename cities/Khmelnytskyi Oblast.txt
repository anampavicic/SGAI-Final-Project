}}'''Khmelnytskyi Oblast''' ({{langx|uk|Хмельницька область|translit=Khmelnytska oblast}}), also known as '''Khmelnychchyna''' ({{langx|uk|Хмельниччина}}), is an [[administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblast]] (province) in western [[Ukraine]] covering portions of the historical regions of western [[Podolia]] and southern [[Volhynia]]. The [[Capital (political)|administrative center]] of the oblast is the city of [[Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine|Khmelnytskyi]].

The current estimated population is around {{Ua-pop-est2022|1,228,829|.}}

Created in 1937 out of border okrugs of [[Vinnytsia Oblast]], in 1941–44 it was under [[Nazi Germany]] occupation and part of the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] (Wolhynien und Podolien general district). Following the [[Kamenets-Podolsky pocket]] in spring of 1944 as part of the Proskurov-Chernovtsy operation, Soviet troops removed the German occupation in the region. Until 4 February 1954 it was called '''Kamianets-Podilskyi Oblast''' ({{Langx|uk|Кам'янець-Подільська область|translit=Kamianets-Podilska oblast}}) and was centered in [[Kamianets-Podilsky]] until 1941. The region rebranding took place after the official renaming of the region's administrative center to [[Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine|Khmelnytskyi]].

==Geography==
Khmelnytskyi Oblast has a total area of {{convert|20600|km²|2|abbr=on}} (3.4% of the total area of Ukraine) and is located between 48°27' and 50°37' north latitude and between 26°09' and 27°56' east longitude. It is {{convert|220|km|2|abbr=on}} long when measured from north to south, and is {{convert|120|km|2|abbr=on}} in length when measured from east to west. It is associated with a historical region of [[Podolia]], yet in reality its territory is split almost in half, the northern in [[Volhynia]], and the southern in [[Podolia]]. Its Volhynian region contains smaller cities like [[Iziaslav, Ukraine|Iziaslav]], [[Starokostiantyniv]], [[Shepetivka]], while its Podolian portion more developed cities of [[Khmelnytskyi]] and [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]].

The oblast borders the [[Rivne Oblast]] to the northwest, the [[Zhytomyr Oblast]] to the northeast, the [[Vinnytsia Oblast]] to the east, the [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] to the south, and the [[Ternopil Oblast]] to the west.

===Elevations===

The [[Podolian Upland]] (270–370 meters above [[sea-level]]) occupies the central area of the Khmelnytskyi Oblast. The northwestern areas of the oblast are part of the [[Volyn]] highland (highest point — 329 m above sea-level), while to the north, the oblast claims a part of the historic region of [[Polesia#Geography|Polissia]] (highest point — 200–250 m above sea-level). The southwestern territory of the Khmelnytskyi Oblast is crossed by the Tovtry range ({{langx|uk|Товтровий кряж}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] ''Tovtryi kryazh''), which includes Mount [[Velyka Buhaikha]] ({{langx|uk|Велика Бугаїха}}), the highest point of the oblast at 409 m above sea-level. The extreme south of the oblast has a surface with canyon-like river valleys. The [[Dneister Reservoir]] located there is the lowest point of the oblast (121 m above sea-level) .

===Rivers and Lakes===

There are 120 rivers with a length of {{convert|10|km|2|abbr=on}} or more in the Khmelnytskyi Oblast. The largest of these are the [[Dniester]] River (which flows for {{convert|160|km|2|abbr=on}} within the oblast), as well as its [[tributaries]]: [[Smotrych River|Smotrych]], [[Ushytsia River|Ushytsia]], and the [[Zbruch River|Zbruch]] — and the [[Southern Buh]] River (which flows for {{convert|120|km|2|abbr=on}} within the oblast), as well as its tributaries: [[Buzhok River|Buzhok]], [[Ikva River|Ikva]], and [[Vovk River|Vovk]]. The rivers of the Dnieper River's basin — [[Horyn River|Horyn]], [[Khomora River|Khmora]], and [[Sluch River (Ukraine)|Sluch Rivers]] also run through the oblast. The oblast's lakes are located mostly in basin of the Horyn River. The largest reservoir in the oblast is the Dniester Reservoir.

There are 1858 ponds and/or reservoirs in the oblast. The largest of these include Shchedrivske (with a surface area of {{cvt|12.58|km2}}), Novostavske (with a surface area of {{cvt|11.68|km2}}), and Kuzmynske (with a surface area of {{cvt|7.65|km2}}).

==History==
Historic administrative affiliation of the area:
* 1937-1941: [[USSR]], [[Ukrainian SSR]]
* 1944-1991: [[USSR]], [[Ukrainian SSR]]
* since 1991: [[Ukraine]]: <small>Khmelnytskyi Oblast </small>

Khmelnytskyi Oblast was created on September 22, 1937, as the Kamianets-Podilskyi Oblast ({{langx|uk|Кам’янець-Подільськa область}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]], ''Kamyanets-Podil'ska oblast’'') out of border okrugs (Proskuriv and Kamianets-Podilskyi) of the [[Vinnytsia Oblast]].

In March 1941 the [[development of the administrative divisions of Ukraine|administrative center of the oblast]] was moved from [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]] to the city of Proskuriv. During the [[World War II]] the territory was part of another administrative division (General District Wolhynien und Podolien, see [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]), but after [[modern history of Ukraine|liberation from the Nazi Germany]], Khmelnytskyi Oblast was reinstated in its original borders. In 1954, Proskuriv was renamed Khmelnytskyi, and soon afterward, the oblast was renamed to Khmelnytskyi Oblast ({{langx|uk|Хмельницька область}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]], ''Khmel'nytska oblast’'').
