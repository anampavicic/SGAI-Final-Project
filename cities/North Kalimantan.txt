'''North Kalimantan''' ({{langx|id|Kalimantan Utara}}) is a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province of Indonesia]]. It is located on the northernmost of [[Kalimantan]], the Indonesian part of the island of [[Borneo]]. North Kalimantan borders the [[Malaysia]]n states of [[Sabah]] to the north and [[Sarawak]] to the west, and by the Indonesian province of [[East Kalimantan]] to the south. [[Tanjung Selor]] serves as the capital of the province, while [[Tarakan]] is the largest city and the financial centre.

Formed on 25 October 2012, North Kalimantan was separated from the province of East Kalimantan to reduce development disparity and Malaysia's influence over the territory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kaltara.antaranews.com/berita/447842/kalimantan-utara-menggeliat|title=Kalimantan Utara Menggeliat|language=id}}</ref> North Kalimantan covers 70,650.73 square kilometres and consists of four [[regency (Indonesia)|regencies]] and one [[List of regencies and cities in Indonesia|city]].

== History ==
<!--[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Steiger en olietanks van de Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij (BPM) op het eiland Tarakan TMnr 60018735.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tarakan]] City during [[Dutch East Indies]] era, picture taken in 1873.]]
[[File:Tarakanmonument, achterkant.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tarakan]] Monument.]]-->


North Kalimantan is the territory of the [[Sultanate of Bulungan]], which was founded by a group of coastal [[Kayan people (Borneo)|Kayan]]. Around the 16th century, a Kayan princess called, Asung Luwan, married a visiting nobleman from [[Brunei]], called Datuk Mencang. From this line a princely state was established, centred in [[Tanjung Selor]], which had territory of Bulungan, Tana Tidung, Malinau, Nunukan, Tarakan, and some part of Sabah. Bulungan was a vassal of Berau, which in turn was a vassal of [[Kutai|Kingdom of Kutai]]. During subsequent wars, the territory fell into the hands of Brunei and after agreements were made with the Sultanate of Sulu, the territory officially came under Sulu control. In 1777, the royal family converted to Islam, with the king Wira Amir changing his name to Aji Muhammad, and title to Sultan Amirul Mukminin. In 1853, The Dutch signed a Politiek Contract to impose their sovereignty over the Bulungan kingdom, Sulu was not able to respond as it was also in [[Spanish–Moro conflict|a war with Spain]]. Then in 1881, the [[British North Borneo Company]] (BNBC) was formed, placing North Borneo (present-day Sabah) under British jurisdiction, and claiming the region of Tawau. While under Dutch control, the sultan was forced to hand over control of the Bahau river, Pujungan river, and Apo Kayan. After long negotiation with the British, the Dutch recognised the British borders in 1915 which became modern the border between Sabah and North Kalimantan. During [[World War II]], the Japanese occupying forces had an agreements with [[Sultanate of Bulungan|Bulungan]] in which they shared natural resources and in exchange the region largely escaped the [[Romusha]] system.<ref name="Indonesia.go.id 2019">{{cite web | title=Kesultanan Bulungan yang Enggan Berperang | website=Indonesia.go.id | date=2019-09-22 | url=https://www.indonesia.go.id/ragam/budaya/sosial/kesultanan-bulungan-yang-enggan-berperang | language=id | access-date=2021-09-12}}</ref><ref name="KajoMag 2021">{{cite web | title=The rise and fall of Bulungan sultanate, a Muslim kingdom with Kayan roots • KajoMag | website=KajoMag | date=2021-06-07 | url=https://kajomag.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-bulungan-sultanate-a-muslim-kingdom-with-kayan-roots/ | access-date=2021-09-12}}</ref>

=== Bultiken Tragedy ===

In 1963, during the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]], the [[Sultanate of Bulungan]]'s position on the formation of Malaysia was ambiguous. In April 1964, it was reported that a document was found proving the ties between Bulungan aristocracy and Malaysia and in conflict would support the formation of Malaysia and in turn join Malaysia. On 24 April 1964, leader of regional military commands Mulawarman, Brigadier General Soeharjo ordered the capture and killing of Bulungan aristocracy. On 2 July 1964, Lt B. Simatupang and Captain Buntaran were received cordially by the Sultan of Bulungan. By 3 July 1964, the palace was invaded by units of Brawijaya 517, the palace was burned and looted, and members of the royal family killed. According to Burhan Djabier in his 1991 book, ''East Kalimantan: The Decline of a Commercial Aristocracy'', the central TNI leadership did not act or replace him because, Brigadier General Soeharjo was a known leftist and  politically connected.<ref name="Raditya 2017">{{cite web | last=Raditya | first=Iswara N | title=Tragedi Pembantaian Bulungan di Perbatasan Malaysia | website=tirto.id | date=2017-08-23 | url=https://tirto.id/tragedi-pembantaian-bulungan-di-perbatasan-malaysia-cu4N | language=id | access-date=2021-09-12}}</ref> Most leftists and the [[Communist Party of Indonesia|PKI]] were hostile to royals causing parallels the [[East Sumatra revolution]]. This is also the position of the sultanate, as according to Dato' Seri Pangeran Sanusi Hussin, the PKI was responsible for the burning of the royal palace and ethnic cleansing.<ref name="liputan6.com 2017">{{cite web | title=50 Tahun Hijrah ke Malaysia, Raja Bulungan Ingin Balik Indonesia | website=liputan6.com | date=2017-03-09 | url=https://www.liputan6.com/regional/read/2880883/50-tahun-hijrah-ke-malaysia-raja-bulungan-ingin-balik-indonesia | language=id | access-date=2021-09-12}}</ref>

The surviving royal family fled and became citizens of Malaysia. In 2017, the royal family announced that they were in the process of becoming Indonesian citizens.<ref name="liputan6.com 2017"/>

== Transport ==
<!--[[File:Jalan Trans Kalimantan Utara.JPG|thumb|left|Trans-[[Kalimantan]] Tollroad highway, was established in 2019 by [[Joko Widodo]].]]-->
[[Tarakan Airport]] also known as [[Juwata International Airport]] on the eponymous island serves the province, as well as an international ferry port with services to Malaysia from [[Tawau]].  There are no international land crossings – entrance into the mainland of the province is by ferry from Tarakan or by road from the south. Large stretches of the roads in this province are of unpaved muddy ditches.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/border-disputes/north-kalimantan-indonesias-newest-province-and-southeast-asian-geopolitical-tensions | title=North Kalimantan: Indonesia's Newest Province and Southeast Asian Geopolitical Tensions}}</ref>

The airport area and runway is also shared with Suharnoko Harbani Air Force Base, a Type A airbase of the [[Indonesian Air Force|TNI-AU]] (Indonesian Air Force). The airbase is named after the former [[Ministry of Industry (Indonesia)|Minister of Industry]] of Indonesia, Suharnoko Harbani, who was also formerly an Air Force officer. Formed in 2006, the establishment of this air base is essentially part of the strategy and efforts to realize the defense of the country from the potential and development of threats that will threaten the Indonesia as well as the organization's demands from the Air Force Operations Command II in [[Makassar]] to facilitate control of its duties. Before the formation of the Air Base, there was already an Indonesian Air Force post which was under the Balikpapan Air Force Base but due to the development of situation and tension with Malaysia in [[Ambalat]], the leadership of the Air Force decided to form a new airbase. Due to the airport is used both by military and civil aviation, so the apron is also used together. In July 2014, the airport authority initials to build 183 meters taxiway to the military apron which can accommodate 4 Sukhoi and 2 Hercules together and the project is predicted to be finished in December 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kaltim.tribunnews.com/2014/10/11/bangun-taxiway-183-meter-dari-apron-lanud-tarakan|title=Bangun Taxiway 183 Meter dari Apron Lanud Tarakan|author=Fransina|date=11 October 2014}}</ref>
