'''Brownsville''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|aʊ|n|z|v|ɪ|l}} {{respell|BROWNZ|vil}}) is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]] and the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Cameron County, Texas|Cameron County]], located on the western [[Gulf Coast]] in [[South Texas]], adjacent to the [[Mexico–United States border|border]] with [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]. The city covers {{convert|145.2|sqmi|sqkm|3|abbr=on}}, and had a population of 186,738 at the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=1600000US4810768|title=Census - Geography Profile: Brownsville city, Texas|access-date=March 24, 2022}}</ref> As of the [[2020 U.S. Census]], it is the [[List of United States cities by population|135th-largest city]] in the United States and [[List of cities in Texas by population|18th-largest]] in Texas. It is part of the [[Matamoros–Brownsville metropolitan area]]. The city is known for its year-round [[subtropical]] climate, deep-water [[seaport]], and Hispanic culture.

The city was founded in 1848 by American entrepreneur [[Charles Stillman]] after he developed a successful river-boat company nearby. It was named for [[Fort Brown]], itself named after Major [[Jacob Brown (Texas soldier)|Jacob Brown]], who fought and died while serving as a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldier during the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848). As a [[county seat]], the city and county governments are major employers. Other primary employers fall within the service, trade, and manufacturing industries, including a growing [[aerospace manufacturer|aerospace]] and [[spaceflight|space transportation]] sector. It operates international trading through the [[Port of Brownsville]]. The city experienced a population increase in the early 1900s, when steel production flourished.

Due to significant historical events, the city has multiple houses and battle sites listed under the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Cameron County, Texas|National Register of Historic Places]]. The city played a primary role in the [[Mexican–American War]] with the [[Siege of Fort Texas]] and the first engagements of the war: [[Battle of Palo Alto|The Battle of Palo Alto]] and [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma|The Battle of Resaca de la Palma]]. Several key events of the [[American Civil War]] took place in the city, such as the [[Battle of Brownsville]] and the [[Battle of Palmito Ranch]]. The city was also involved in the [[Texas Revolution]]. Brownsville's idiosyncratic geographic location has made it a wildlife refuge center. Several state parks and historical sites are protected by the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]].

Brownsville has a predominantly [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] population, which at 93.9% is [[List of U.S. cities with large Hispanic populations|the fourth-highest proportion of Hispanic Americans]] of any city in the [[United States]] outside of [[Puerto Rico]].<ref name="2020Hispanic">{{cite web |title=P2: HISPANIC OR LATINO, AND NOT HISPANIC OR LATINO BY RACE |url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=P2%3A%20HISPANIC%20OR%20LATINO,%20AND%20NOT%20HISPANIC%20OR%20LATINO%20BY%20RACE&g=0100000US%24160000_0400000US72%240500000&tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P2&hidePreview=true |website=2020 Census |publisher=United States Census Bureau |access-date=10 October 2021 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211016235910/https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=P2:%20HISPANIC%20OR%20LATINO,%20AND%20NOT%20HISPANIC%20OR%20LATINO%20BY%20RACE&g=0100000US$160000_0400000US72$0500000&tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P2&hidePreview=true |archive-date=October 16, 2021}}</ref>

=== Founding ===
[[File:Emory-Brownsville.jpg|thumb|left|Brownsville in 1857]]

In 1781, Spanish government officials granted José Salvador de la Garza 59 leagues of land (408 sq mi). He used the land to construct a ranch several miles northwest of the area. During the early 1800s, Brownsville was known to residents as ''los tejidos'' (English: "[[pasture]]lands").<ref name="brownsvillearchive">{{cite web |title=Brownsville from 1846...

On February 4, 1846, President [[James K. Polk]] instructed American General [[Zachary Taylor]] and his troops, including 2nd LT. Ulysses S. Grant, to begin moving south towards Brownsville. Once Taylor arrived, he built [[Forts of Texas#Mexican–American War|Fort Texas]].

[[Charles Stillman]] arrived in Matamoros in 1828 from [[Connecticut]] to help his father in the mercantile business.<ref name="brownsvillearchive"/> Brownsville became part of Texas after the signing of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848.

The city of Brownsville was originally established in late 1848 by Stillman, and was made the county seat of Cameron County on January 13, 1849. The state originally incorporated the city on January 24, 1850. This was repealed on April 1, 1852, because of a land-ownership dispute between Stillman and its former owners (including [[Juan Cortina]], a Mexican rancher). The state reincorporated the city on February 7, 1853; this remains in effect. The issue of ownership was not decided until 1879, when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of Stillman.<ref name="watrousarchive"/>

===Mexican–American War===
{{Main|Mexican–American War}}
[[File:Nebel Mexican War 01 Battle of Palo Alto.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Palo Alto]] was fought on May 8, 1846]]

On April 25, 1846, Captain [[Seth B. Thornton]] received reports of Mexican troops crossing the Rio Grande. Thornton and 63 [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)#Mexican–American War|U.S. dragoons]] moved to Rancho de Carricitos and discovered several houses in the area. Mexican General Anastasio Torrejón crossed the Rio Grande the previous day. He commanded 1,600 cavalry and infantry troops to surround Thornton's troops in fractions. Due to heavy force from Torrejón's troops, Thornton's troops surrendered. Eleven American casualties were reported; 45 troops and Thornton were held as prisoners. Reports of the incident were sent to President James K. Polk, who announced, "American blood has been spilled upon the American territory."

The following day, Mexican troops had retreated. Taylor's troops charged up to them, resulting in the [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]], which took place within the present limits. When Taylor arrived at the besieged Fort Texas, he found that two soldiers, including the fort's commander, Major Jacob Brown, had died. Brown, who suffered an injury when a cannonball hit his leg, died three days after his injury on May 9. In his honor, General Taylor renamed the facility as Fort Brown. An old cannon at the [[University of Texas at Brownsville]] and [[Texas Southmost College]] marks the spot where Major Brown received his fatal wound.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brownsville: Fort Brown |url=http://texastropicaltrail.com/plan-your-adventure/historic-sites-and-cities/sites/fort-brown |website=Texas Tropical Trail |access-date=January 4, 2019 |archive-date=January 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105044609/http://texastropicaltrail.com/plan-your-adventure/historic-sites-and-cities/sites/fort-brown |url-status=live}}</ref>

On July 13, 1859, Juan Cortina saw Brownsville city Marshal Robert Sheers arrest and beat an elderly man who had been a ranch hand at his mother's ranch. Cortina approached the marshal, questioning his motives, before shooting him twice after he refused to release the man. The first shot reportedly missed Sheers, but the second struck his shoulder, causing him to fall to the ground.

===20th century===

Texas, like other Southern states, passed a new constitution and [[Jim Crow]] laws that established racial segregation and disenfranchised African Americans at the turn of the 20th century, generally by raising barriers to voter registration. While Hispanic residents were considered white under the terms of the United States annexation of Texas, legislatures found ways to suppress their participation in politics.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hlavac |first1=Steven |title=Scholar probes lynching of Mexicans in early 20th-century Texas |url=https://www.colorado.edu/asmagazine/2017/11/29/scholar-probes-lynching-mexicans-early-20th-century-texas |website=[[University of Colorado]] |access-date=January 4, 2019 |date=November 29, 2017 |archive-date=January 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105043305/https://www.colorado.edu/asmagazine/2017/11/29/scholar-probes-lynching-mexicans-early-20th-century-texas |url-status=live}}</ref>

====Railroad====
Several attempts were made to attract a railroad, but the [[St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway]] did not reach Brownsville until 1904. In 1910, a railroad bridge was constructed between Brownsville and Matamoros (Mexico), and regular service between the two towns began. The introduction of the rail link to Brownsville opened the area for settlement by northern farmers, who subsequently arrived in the lower Rio Grande Valley in large numbers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Onion |first1=Rebecca |title=America's Lost History of Border Violence |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/05/texas-finally-begins-to-grapple-with-its-ugly-history-of-border-violence-against-mexican-americans.html |access-date=January 5, 2019 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=May 5, 2016 |archive-date=January 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105145306/https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/05/texas-finally-begins-to-grapple-with-its-ugly-history-of-border-violence-against-mexican-americans.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

The new settlers cleared the land of brush, built extensive irrigation systems and roads, and introduced large-scale truck farming. In 1904, H. G. Stillwell Sr. planted the first commercial citrus orchard in the area, thus opening the way for citrus fruit culture, one of the valley's leading industries. The expansion of farming in the area, and the railroad link to the north, brought new prosperity to Brownsville and spurred a host of civic improvements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdb04|title=The Handbook of Texas: Brownsville|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]|access-date=May 20, 2015|archive-date=November 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112123510/https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdb04|url-status=live}}</ref>
