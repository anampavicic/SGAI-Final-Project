'''Bangui''' ({{IPA|fr|bɑ̃ɡi}}; or '''Bangî''' in [[Sango language|Sango]], formerly written '''Bangi''' in English) is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and [[List of cities in the Central African Republic|largest city]] of the [[Central African Republic]]. It was established as a [[French Congo|French]] outpost in 1889 and named after its location on the northern bank of the [[Ubangi River]] ({{langx|fr|Oubangui}}); the Ubangi itself was named from the [[Bobangi language|Bobangi]] word for the "rapids" located beside the settlement,<ref>Room, Adrian. ''African Placenames: Origins and Meanings of the Names for Natural Features, Towns, Cities, Provinces, and Counties'', 2nd ed., p.&nbsp;30: "Bangui". McFarland & Co., 2008. {{ISBN|0786435461}}.</ref> which marked the end of navigable water north from [[Brazzaville]]. The majority of the population of the Central African Republic lives in the western parts of the country, in Bangui and the surrounding area.

The city has been part of [[Bangui (Prefecture)|Bangui Prefecture]] since December 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Oubangui Médias |first1=Oubangui Médias |title=La Centrafrique dispose désormais de 20 préfectures et de 84 sous-préfectures |url=https://oubanguimedias.com/2020/12/11/la-centrafrique-dispose-desormais-de-20-prefectures-et-de-84-sous-prefectures/ |website=oubanguimedias.com |date=11 December 2020 |publisher=Oubangi Medias |access-date=27 May 2023}}</ref> {{As of|2020}} it had an estimated population of 889,231.

The city consists of eight urban districts (''[[arrondissements]]''), 16 groups (''groupements'') and 205 neighbourhoods (''quartiers''). As the capital of the Central African Republic, Bangui acts as an administrative, trade, and commercial centre. The National Assembly, government buildings, banks, foreign enterprises and embassies, hospitals, hotels, main markets and the Ngaragba Central Prison are all located here. Bangui manufactures [[textiles]], food products, [[beer]], [[shoes]] and [[soap]]. Its [[Cathédrale Notre-Dame (Bangui)|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bangui]]. The city is also home to the [[University of Bangui]], inaugurated in 1970. It is served by the [[Bangui M'Poko International Airport]].

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Bangui}}
[[Archaeology|Archaeological studies]] in and around Bangui have yielded at least 26 ancient [[Iron Age]] sites that contain many [[Metallurgy|metallurgical tools and object]]s, illuminating the pre-European history of the city and surrounding area.<ref name="unesco">{{cite web|url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/4005/|title= Les sites paléo-métallurgiques de Bangui |publisher= UNESCO World Heritage Centre|access-date=30 March 2013}}</ref> The archaeological sites were added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on 11 April 2006 in the Cultural category.<ref name="unesco" /> The site closest to Bangui is Pendere-Sengue, {{Convert|800|m}} from Independence Avenue, where archaeologists and conservation agencies have carried out studies. It is a paleo-metallurgical site where several thousand shards of ceramics, iron tools, pottery, and an iron spatula weighing {{Convert|9|kg}} have been unearthed. Its dating, compared with similar sites in [[Nigeria]] and [[Sudan]], could be close to the ninth century BC.<ref name="unesco" />

[[File:Peace pact between Dolisie and Chief Gbembo stamp.jpg|thumb|left|Dolisie and Chief Gbembo sign a pact in 1889 leading to Bangui's founding (commemorated on a 1989 stamp)]]
The modern settlement of Bangui was founded by Michel Dolisie and Alfred Uzac on 26 June 1889 on the direction of [[Brazzaville]] administrator Albert Dolisie.{{Sfn|Kalck|2005|p=LIII}} It was located in what was then the upper reaches of the [[French Congo]], the present-day [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]]. The original site was {{cvt|10|km|}} south of the Ubangi rapids. Its territory was organized first into the territory of the Upper Ubangi (''{{lang|fr|Haut-Oubangui}}'') and then as the separate colony of [[Ubangi-Shari]].{{Sfn|Haggett|2002|p=2329}} The initial capitals of these areas were at [[les Abiras]] and [[Fort de Possel]] further upstream, but the rapids at Bangui blocked them from direct communication along the river and caused the settlement there to grow in importance until, in 1906, it was chosen as the new headquarters for the French administration. Bangui retained its importance as a military and administrative centre when the colony was folded into [[French Equatorial Africa]] and under both [[Vichy France|Vichy]] and [[Free France|Free French]] control during [[World War II]]. The French operated a [[Radio|radio transmitter]] in Bangui, which was described in 1932 as "the most remote radio station in Africa".<ref name="Magazines1932">{{cite journal|title=Popular Mechanics|journal = Popular Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YeIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA535|date=October 1932|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=535|issn=0032-4558}}</ref>

[[File:Bangui 1960.jpg|thumb|Bangui in 1960]]
The colony of [[Ubangi-Shari]] received its autonomy in 1958 as the Central African Republic and became independent from France in 1960. In 1970, President [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] inaugurated the [[University of Bangui]].{{Sfn|Titley|1997|p=69}} He established the national airline Air Centrafrique the following year and ordered the construction of two new luxury [[hotel]]s in Bangui. With tensions mounting between Bangui and [[Paris]] as a result of Bokassa's uncontrollable expenditures, western [[bank]]s refused to lend him any more money.{{Sfn|Titley|1997|p=69}} Relations with the French worsened still further in April 1974, when the body of Brigette Miroux was discovered in a hotel room in Bangui. Miroux was a native of northern France who in 1973 came to the Central African Republic to become a "hostess" in Bokassa's [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]] aircraft.{{sfn|Titley|1997|p=56}} It was reported in the French media that she had been Bokassa's mistress and that he was responsible for her murder.{{Sfn|Titley|1997|p=69}} As a result, Bokassa banned import of French [[newspaper]]s and assumed control of the [[Agence France-Presse]] office in Bangui.{{Sfn|Titley|1997|p=69}} By 1975, Bangui had a population of 300,723.<ref name="CP">{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Centralafrica.html|title=Central Africa|publisher=Citypopulation.de|access-date=30 March 2013}}</ref>

In March 1981, widespread violence took place in Bangui following elections, after [[Operation Caban]] led the French to drop Bokassa (who had begun to call himself [[Emperor Bokassa I]]) and to replace him with [[David Dacko]]. Opponents of the President met in Bangui and were forced to flee the country. After returning voluntarily to Bangui in the autumn of 1986,{{Sfn|Shillington|2004|p=407}} Bokassa went on trial. Initially faced with the death penalty, in February 1988 he was instead sentenced to life imprisonment.{{Sfn|Shillington|2004|p=407}} His successor was General [[André Kolingba]], army chief of staff of Dacko's army, who took over control from the local French military on 1 September 1981 under the pretext that the country was heading towards civil war. Although he attempted to combat corruption and control the national economy, he was unable to achieve his reforms. By the middle of the 1980s the country's economic situation had deteriorated as 80% of the revenue went towards meeting the salaries of the staff.{{Sfn|Shillington|2004|pp=406-407}}
Under pressure from a donor group called GIBAFOR (France, USA, Japan, Germany, EU, World Bank and the UN) Kolingba made moves to restore a degree of democracy in the country in 1991 with a multiparty government. Elections were held in 1993 and 1994. The first round was sabotaged by the government when it was clear they would lose. Under continued donor pressure elections were held again in 1994 as before with help from the UN Electoral Assistance Division. During these elections, [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] was elected to the post of president. Since he was from northern CAR, the southern group of Kolingba started a rebellion during 1996.{{Sfn|Shillington|2004|pp=406-407}}

In May 1996, about 200 soldiers of the Central African Republic mutinied in Bangui, demanding salary increases and the abdication of Ange-Félix Patassé.<ref name=Institute>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inadev.org/profile_-_central_african_republic.htm|title=Profile Central African Republic|access-date=10 January 2014|publisher=Institute for African Development|archive-date=24 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034119/http://www.inadev.org/profile_-_central_african_republic.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the aftermath, the renegades plundered and killed more than 50 people.<ref name=Institute/> Following this, the French troops stationed in the country suppressed the rebellion and restored the dictatorial power. After being elected, President Patassé announced a national unity government in early 1997. The Patassé government, the opposition parties, and religious groups signed the [[Bangui Agreements]] in January 1997 which were a series of measures designed to reconcile competing political factions, reform and strengthen the economy.{{sfn|McKenna|2011|p=37}} The same year, the rebel troops refused a military base in Bangui and in June a new revolt broke out.

In view of frequent political unrest the city was named in 1996 as one of the most dangerous cities in the world.{{Sfn|Doeden|2009|p=16}} On 25 October 2002, several towns in the country and later Bangui itself were [[2002 Central African Republic coup attempt|attacked]] by the forces of General [[François Bozizé]], backed with international support.<ref name="Yearbook of the United Nations">{{cite book|title=Yearbook of the United Nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yp2sSGFOXAgC&pg=PA145|year=2004|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=978-92-1-100904-0|page=145}}</ref> Bozizé refused to accept an arrest warrant and "defected with about a hundred troops, engaged in street battles in the northern neighborhoods of Bangui (traditionally supporting Patassé)" and went north.{{Sfn|Villalón|VonDoepp|2005|p=146}} Bozizé went into exile in [[Chad]]{{Sfn|Villalón|VonDoepp|2005|p=146}} but his troops returned to Bangui and fighting continued. Peace-keeping forces were ineffective, leaving Patassé isolated, and with support from Chad, Bozizé's troops were successful in removing Patassé's government. Patassé, who was returning from Niger after attending a conference, was not permitted to land in Bangui and he took asylum in [[Togo]], and Bozizé seized power and suspended the constitution. An all-party National Transitional Government was set up which functioned as an interim legislative body. However, the "climate of distrust continued".{{Sfn|Villalón|VonDoepp|2005|pp=147-48}}

In late 2012, the [[Séléka]] coalition rebelled against the autocratic rule of Bozizé and [[Central African Republic Civil War#Fall of Bangui|entered the city]]. After capturing [[Bria, Central African Republic|Bria]], [[Sibut]], and other important towns, they were on the verge of capturing [[Damara, Central African Republic|Damara]], the last strategic town before Bangui.

In January 2013, the rebels terminated their operations, hoping for a negotiated settlement.<ref name=rebellion/> Following a [[ceasefire]] and a power-sharing agreement, Séléka and Bozizé agreed to honour the rebel's demands for the release of rebel prisoners and the expulsion of foreign troops from the country.

Bangui, close to the country's southern border, lies on the northern banks of the [[Ubangi River]] just below a series of rapids that limit major commercial shipping upriver.{{Sfn|Haggett|2002|p=2329}} The only major city located on the river, it covers an area of {{Convert|67|km2}}. The navigable Ubangi River, with the backdrop of lush green hills, turns sharply south below Bangui and connects to the [[Congo River]] just south of the equator near Brazzaville as its chief northern tributary. The Ubangi river marks the border between the Central African Republic and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The Congolese town of [[Zongo, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zongo]] is situated across the river from Bangui.{{Sfn|Pritchard-Jones|Gibbons|2009|p=43}} The river flows to the east of downtown Bangui. During the rainy season the discharge in the river is three times higher than during the rest of the year. The city was also known as ''La Coquette'' (the beautiful city) in the 1970s.{{Sfn|Ham|2010|page=544}}
[[File:Map - Arrondissements and Quartiers in the agglomeration of Bangui.png|thumb|left|Map of Arrondissements and Quartiers in the area of Bangui]]
Close to the river, the city centre features a large [[triumphal arch|arch]] dedicated to Bokassa as well as the presidential palace and the central [[Market (place)|market]]. Lying {{Convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=off|spell=on}} further north, the heart of the residential area has the largest market and most of the [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]].

}}After the Central African Republic attained independence in 1960, developmental activities began, and the urbanization of Bangui ensued. This is evidenced by the population growth from 279,800 in 1975 to 427,435 in 1988<ref name="CP"/> to 524,000 by 1994,<ref name="Merriam-Webster's collegiate encyclopedia">{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V2d12iZkgOwC&pg=PA138|year=2000|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-017-4|page=138}}</ref> and to 652,000 in 2001.{{Sfn|Eyoh|Zeleza|2002|p=45}} Apart from the ethnic people of the country, the city is also home for a minority group of Greek, Portuguese and Yemeni traders, and also has a small community of [[French people]]. The Bangui resident community includes diamond traders from western Africa and Chad, traders from many African countries, and refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria.<ref name=Republic/>

The official languages of the country are [[French language|French]] and [[Sango language|Sango]]; the latter (originally a language from the Ubangi River region) is spoken by 90% of the population. Some of the other languages spoken are [[Gbaya people|Baya]] (Gbaya), [[Banda languages|Banda]], [[Ngbaka languages|Ngbaka]], [[Sara languages|Sara]], [[Mbum language|Mbum]], [[Kare language (Adamawa)|Kare]], and [[Mandjia]]. Sango was simplified by Christian missionaries and is widely used to this day.<ref name=Republic/>

== Economy ==
[[File:Trading methods in Bangui Market.jpg|thumb|right|Local traders]]
Bangui serves as an administrative, trade, and commercial centre. During the Second World War the country became wealthier as exports of rubber, cotton, coffee, uranium and diamonds increased.{{Sfn|Eyoh|Zeleza|2002|p=45}} After the war, the employment of local people in mainstream administration led to the development of the country's infrastructure, which increased trade while slowing the national movement for independence.{{Sfn|Eyoh|Zeleza|2002|p=45}}

During David Dacko's presidency from 1960 to 1966, there was a significant increase in the production of [[diamond]]s.{{sfn|Law|2011|p=7}} This occurred when the monopoly of the French concessionary companies was ended with a law allowing local citizens to dig for diamonds. After Dacko set up a [[diamond cutting]] factory at Bangui, diamonds became the country's leading export. But by the end of his five-year tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers being left unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in a military coup in 1966.{{sfn|Law|2011|p=7}}
Concurrently, Bangui also became the key centre for social and cultural activity in the region, when new institutions were established in the city. However, political turmoil in the country, rampant corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic recession in the 1970s exacerbated by a fall in international prices for its major exports. This caused impoverishment of the people and severe conflict, further compounded by refugees migrating from troubled neighbouring countries.{{Sfn|Eyoh|Zeleza|2002|p=45}}

Bangui received its first bank in 1946 when a branch of the [[Bank of West Africa (BAO)|Bank of West Africa]] was established there. Arab sellers dominated the city, and it was historically an important centre for [[ivory]] trading.<ref name="Information1980">{{cite book|title=New Scientist|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_80VdP6yOSOoC|access-date=30 March 2013|date=3 July 1980|publisher=Reed Business Information|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_80VdP6yOSOoC/page/n34 33]|issn=0262-4079}}</ref> Bangui manufactures include [[textiles]], food products, beer, [[shoes]], and [[soap]].{{Sfn|Eyoh|Zeleza|2002|p=45}} The main exports are [[cotton]], [[rubber]], [[timber]], [[coffee]], and [[sisal]].{{Sfn|Eyoh|Zeleza|2002|p=45}} Because of the ongoing strife, unemployment hovered near 23% in the city {{As of|2001|lc=on}}. [[Ngaragba Central Prison]], the national prison for men, is located in Bangui. {{As of|2007}}, it had 476 inmates; prison conditions are reported to be poor.{{Sfn|Egyesült|2007|p=87}}

Most of the holidays in Bangui are festivals related to the Christian and Muslim faiths and are the same as those observed in other parts of the world. National holidays include independence day and the birthdays of Boganda and several other national heroes.{{Sfn|Woodfork|2006|p=145}}

Bangui is the transport hub of the Central African Republic. As of 1999, eight roads connected the city to other main towns in the country, Cameroon, Chad and [[South Sudan]]; of these, only the toll roads are paved. During the rainy season from March to November, some roads are impassable.{{Sfn|Eur|2003|pp=200{{ndash}}202}}{{Sfn|Booth|McDuell|McDuell|Sears|1999|p=57}} The road network in the city emanates from the Palace de la Republique.{{Sfn|Ham|2010|p=547}}

==Healthcare==
A general hospital is located in the eastern side of the city. Modern health care facilities exist only in Bangui but are poor, providing only minimal care. Wealthier citizens make use of private clinics.<ref name=health/> The risk of catching [[HIV]] in the city is reportedly high, and many truck drivers stopping in the city for sexual services pose a major risk of spreading the disease to other parts of the country.{{Sfn|Bethell|2005|p=113}}{{Better source needed|reason=source is the notoriously politicized and poorly sourced book by conservative journalist Tom Bethell||date=July 2024}} The risk of catching [[malaria]] in Bangui and pygmy camps is also much higher than in the rest of the country.{{Sfn|Mouchet|Carnevale|Manguin|2008|p=117}}

A conference of public health officials including representatives of the [[Centers for Disease Control]] and the [[World Health Organization]] was held in Bangui in October 1985. The conference evolved a diagnostic definition of AIDS which came to be known as the [[1985 World Health Organization AIDS surveillance case definition|Bangui definition]] for AIDS.<ref name="CP"/>{{Sfn|Jenkins|2009|p=4}} The conference defined symptoms of AIDS in Africa as "prolonged fever for a month or more, weight loss of over 10% and prolonged diarrhea".{{Sfn|Holmberg|2008|p=50}} The Bangui definition proved problematic as immune suppression can also be caused by [[malnutrition]].{{Sfn|Jenkins|2009|p=4}}

==Media==
Several [[Periodical literature|periodicals]] and three daily [[newspaper]]s are published in Bangui: ''E le Songo'', the country's first newspaper, began publication in 1982.
