'''Ciénaga''' ({{IPA|es|ˈsjenaɣa}}) is a municipality and city in the [[Magdalena Department]], [[Colombia]], the second largest population center in this department, after the city of [[Santa Marta]]. It is situated at [[11th parallel north|11° 00' North]], 74° 15' West, between the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the [[Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta]] marsh in northern Colombia. The city is situated in the northern part of Magdalena, 35&nbsp;km from Santa Marta. According to estimations in 2020, the city had a population of 110,303.<ref name="pop" /> The mean annual temperature is 34&nbsp;°C.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of the Spanish colonizers the area was vastly populated by [[Chimila people|Chimila]] indigenous people and a village known as ''Pongueyca''. The foundation of Ciénaga has always been a matter of dispute due to many different historical theories and the lack of documented sources. It is believed to be founded first in what is now a small village known as Pueblo Viejo and the site of a former Chimila tribe. In 1529 monk Fray Tomás Ortiz established a parish that would later burn in a fire. It was then refounded as a city by Fernando de Mier y Guerra under the name of ''Villa de San Juan Bautista de la Ciénaga'' but also was known with the names of ''San Juan del Córdoba'', ''Aldea Grande'', ''Córdoba'', ''Pueblo de la Ciénaga'' and simply ''Ciénaga''.

During the Venezuelan War of Independence from Spain, Ciénaga became a battle ground on November 10, 1820, between loyalists and independentists of what became known as the [[Battle of Ciénaga]].

On December 6, 1928, the [[Banana Massacre]] (in Spanish, ''matanza de las bananeras'') occurred in the town. It was a [[massacre]] of 100 to 2,000 people during a month-long strike of workers for the [[United Fruit Company]]; an unknown number of workers died after the government decided to send the military forces.

In 2012, the Colombian government named Ciénaga a ''[[Pueblo Patrimonio (Colombia)|Pueblo Patrimonio]]'' (heritage town) of Colombia, making it the first town in Magdalena department to earn the distinction.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Heraldo|first=El|title=Ciénaga, declarado pueblo patrimonio de Colombia|url=https://www.elheraldo.co/region/cienaga-declarado-pueblo-patrimonio-de-colombia-84725|access-date=2021-03-30|website=EL HERALDO|language=es}}</ref> As of March 2021, Ciénaga is Colombia's northernmost ''Pueblo Patrimonio''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=Dec 2020|title=GUÍA: Red Turística de Pueblos Patrimonio de Colombia|url=https://fontur.com.co/sites/default/files/2020-12/GUIA_PUEBLOS_PATRIMONIO.pdf|url-status=live|access-date=29 Mar 2021|website=Fondo Nacional de Turismo de la República de Colombia - FONTUR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210403060020/https://fontur.com.co/sites/default/files/2020-12/GUIA_PUEBLOS_PATRIMONIO.pdf |archive-date=2021-04-03 }}</ref>

==Culture==
Ciénaga has been the place of birth and home to numerous notable people, including native [[Thousand Days' War]] hero, musician and farmer [[Colonel]] Clemente Escalona, father and teacher of [[vallenato]] composer [[Rafael Escalona]]. [[Guillermo Buitrago]], who died very young - 29 years old - became a very important figure of the 20th century's [[folklore]] in Colombia. The city pays annual homage to him in the Guillermo de Jesús Buitrago Guitar Festival. It was also the birthplace of Andrés Paz Barrosthe, [[cumbia]] cienaguera founder and musical composer. Ciénaga celebrates every year on January 20 the ''Fiesta del Caimán'' (Feast of the [[Caiman]]) honoring a local legend known as ''La Historia de Tomasita''.

The impact of the banana industry on Ciénaga and the surrounding region is depicted in several stories by [[Gabriel García Márquez]] in ''[[100 Years of Solitude]]'' and ''The Leaf Storm''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.colombia.travel/en/international-tourist/sightseeing-what-to-do/colombia-thematic-routes/garcia-marquez/cienaga |title=Colombia Tourism Ministry |access-date=2012-05-07 |archive-date=2014-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429180707/http://www.colombia.travel/en/international-tourist/sightseeing-what-to-do/colombia-thematic-routes/garcia-marquez/cienaga |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Important to note this town was also the principal port of Colombia during the late 19th century and was where the largest immigrant groups entered Colombia, mainly from Lebanon and Europe.
