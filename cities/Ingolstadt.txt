'''Ingolstadt''' ({{IPA|de|ˈɪŋɡɔlˌʃtat|lang|De-Ingolstadt.ogg}}; <small>[[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]]:</small> {{IPA|bar|ˈɪŋl̩ʃtɔːd|}}) is an [[Independent city#Germany|independent city]]{{Efn|Called an {{Interlanguage link|Independent city (Germany)|de|3=Kreisfreie Stadt}} in German}} on the [[Danube]], in [[Upper Bavaria]], with 142,308 inhabitants (as of December 31, 2023).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ingolstadt |first=Stadt |title=Aktuelle Zahlen und Statistiken |url=https://www.ingolstadt.de/Rathaus/Aktuelles/Zahlen-Daten/Aktuelle-Statistiken/ |access-date=2024-07-25 |website=Stadt Ingolstadt |language=de-DE}}</ref> Around half a million people live in the metropolitan area. Ingolstadt is the second largest city in Upper Bavaria after [[Munich]] and the [[List of cities in Bavaria by population|fifth largest city]] in Bavaria after Munich, [[Nuremberg]], [[Augsburg]] and [[Regensburg]]. The city passed the mark of 100,000 inhabitants in 1989 and has since been one of the major cities in Germany. After Regensburg, Ingolstadt is the second largest German [[List of cities and towns on the Danube river|city on the Danube]].

The city was first mentioned in 806. In the late Middle Ages, the city was one of the capitals of the Bavarian duchies alongside Munich, [[Landshut]] and [[Straubing]], which is reflected in the architecture. On March 13, 1472, Ingolstadt became the seat of the first [[University of Ingolstadt|university in Bavaria]], which later distinguished itself as the center of the [[Counter-Reformation]]. The [[freethinking]] [[Illuminati]] order was also founded here in 1776. The city was also a Bavarian state fortress for more than 400 years. The historic old town has been preserved.

There are two colleges in the city. The place is one of the three regional centers in Bavaria. The city is mainly characterized by the manufacturing industry, such as automobile and mechanical engineering. The unemployment rate was 3.3% in February 2022.

==Geography==
Covering an urban area of {{cvt|133.35|km2|2|abbr=out}}, Ingolstadt is geographically Bavaria's fourth-largest city after Munich, Nuremberg, and Augsburg. At its largest point, the city is about {{cvt|18|km|0|abbr=in}} from east to west and from north to south about {{cvt|15|km|0|abbr=in}}. The city boundary has a length of {{cvt|70|km|0|abbr=in}}.

The city boundary is about {{cvt|14|km|0}} away from the geographic centre of Bavaria in [[Kipfenberg]]. The old town is approximately {{cvt|374|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and the highest point, located in the district of Pettenhofen, is {{cvt|410.87|m|2}}. The lowest point of the Schutter confluence with the Danube is at {{cvt|362|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Ingolstadt uses Central European Time throughout Germany; the average time lag is 14 minutes.

The city is expanding at the northern and southern banks of the Danube in a wide, flat bowl. The Ingolstadt basin borders the Jura foothills, located south and to the north of the Donau-Isar-Hügelland. In the southwest is the Donaumoos, while in the east, the lowland forests of the Danube reach into the urban area. It is the second-largest hardwood floodplain on the Danube. The Sandrach, the former southern main branch of the Danube, partly forms the southern city border. In the north, the Schutter flows through from the west, reaching the Danube near the Altstadt.

==History and culture==
Ingolstadt was first mentioned in a document of [[Charlemagne]] on 6 February 806 as "Ingoldes stat", the place of Ingold.{{clarify|date=March 2023}} {{circa|1250}}, Ingolstadt was granted city status.
[[File:Dankaerts-Historis-9338.tif|thumb|left|Siege of Ingolstadt with cannonade over the river Danube by the [[Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years' War|Swedish army]] of king [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]] in 1632]]
[[File:Liebfrauenmünster Ingolstadt.JPG|thumb|Church of Our Lady]]
[[File:Kreuztor Ingoldstadt.jpg|thumb|The Kreuztor]]
Ingolstadt was the capital of the [[Bavaria-Ingolstadt|Duchy of Bavaria-Ingolstadt]] between 1392 and 1447. Ingolstadt was then united with [[Bavaria-Landshut]]. [[Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria]] ordered the building of the [[New Castle (Ingolstadt)|New Castle]] as well as the Church of Our Lady (Münster zur Schönen Unseren Lieben Frau), also known as "Upper Parish" (Obere Pfarr), whose form was strongly influenced by [[Gothic architecture|French Gothic architecture]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}}

In 1472, [[Louis IX, Duke of Bavaria]] founded the [[University of Ingolstadt]], which became the [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München|Ludwig-Maximilians-University]]. In 1800 it was moved to [[Landshut]] and in 1826 eventually to [[Munich]]. The [[University of Ingolstadt]] was an influential defender of the Roman Catholic Church during the Reformation era, led by such notable scholars as [[Johann Eck]].

Ingolstadt is where [[William IV, Duke of Bavaria]] wrote and signed the Bavarian [[Reinheitsgebot]] in 1516.

On 30 April 1632, the German [[field marshal]] [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]] died at Ingolstadt during a [[Sweden|Swedish]] siege of the city. The field marshal had been badly wounded in a previous engagement with the Swedes under King [[Gustavus Adolphus]]. Ingolstadt proved to be the first fortress in [[Catholic League (German)|Germany]] that held out for the entire length of the Swedish siege, and the Swedes eventually withdrew.{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}}

Gustavus Adolphus' horse remains can be seen in the City Museum. The horse was shot from under the king by one of the cannons inside the fortress, a cannon known as "The Fig". When the Swedes withdrew, the city preserved the remains of the king's horse, eventually putting the {{ill|Schwedenschimmel|de|vertical-align=sup}} on display. It has remained thus for almost 400 years. In 1748, [[Adam Weishaupt]], the founder of the Order of [[Illuminati]], was born in Ingolstadt. After the French invasion in 1799, the fortress was demolished, and the university was relocated to [[Landshut]].

Originally a fortress city, Ingolstadt is enclosed by a [[medieval]] defensive wall. The Bavarian fortress (1537–1930) now holds the [[Bavarian Army Museum|museum of the Bavarian army]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home - Bayerisches Armeemuseum |url=https://www.armeemuseum.de/de/ |access-date=2022-02-11 |website=www.armeemuseum.de |archive-date=2022-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209053752/https://www.armeemuseum.de/de/ |url-status=live }}</ref> During [[World War I]], future [[France|French]] president [[Charles de Gaulle]] was detained there as a [[prisoner of war]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}} A [[sapper]]s' drill ground lies next to the river. Two military air bases are located nearby, one used for testing aircraft. The long military tradition of the city is reflected in today's civil and cultural life. Former "off-limit" military training areas have been converted into well-used public parks.

Adolf Scherzer composed the "[[Bayerischer Defiliermarsch|Bayerischen Defiliermarsch]]". Mary Shelley's ''[[Frankenstein]]'' was set at the ''Ingolstädter Alte Anatomie'' (Old Anatomy Building), now a museum for medical history. [[Marieluise Fleißer]] set her play ''[[Pioneers in Ingolstadt]]'' (1928) in the city.

== Economy ==
In 1945, the car manufacturer [[Auto Union]] first arrived in the city. The company's original factories in [[Chemnitz]] and [[Zwickau]] (both then in Soviet-controlled [[East Germany]]) were shattered during the [[Second World War|war]], and were seized by the Soviets as [[War reparations|reparations]]. Auto Union executives initially started a spare parts operation in Ingolstadt in the immediate post-war period, with a view to relocating the entire company to the region. With the help of [[Marshall Plan]] aid, Auto Union was formally re-founded in Ingolstadt in 1949, ultimately evolving into the modern-era [[Audi|Audi company]], after it was taken over by [[Volkswagen]] in 1964. Today, Audi is the region's largest employer and now dominates the economy of the city.

==Cityscape==

===Main sights===
As one of five ducal residences of medieval Bavaria—besides [[Landshut]], [[Munich]], [[Straubing]] and [[Burghausen, Altötting|Burghausen]]—the city of Ingolstadt features many Gothic buildings, such as the {{lang|de|Herzogskasten}} ('old ducal castle', {{circa|1255}}) and the [[New Castle (Ingolstadt)|New Castle]], which was built from 1418 onwards. The largest church is the Gothic hall church of Our Lady (Liebfrauenmunster), which was begun in 1425. The church was built to serve as a second parish church beside Saint Maurice as well as the burial place for Louis and his family and intended to be the official burial place for the future Dukes of Bavaria-Ingolstadt. Its peculiar and rare angle of footprint was emulated in the 20th century built [[Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Newark)|Cathedral of Newark]]. Also, the churches of Saint Maurice (1235) and of the Gnadenthal and Franciscan monasteries date from the Gothic era. The [[Kreuztor (Ingolstadt)|Kreuztor]] (1385) is one of the remaining gates of the old city wall and to this day the key landmark of the city. The Gothic Old City Hall was constructed in the 14th century and later altered several times.

The Baroque era is represented by the Old Anatomy Building of the university (1723–1736, designed by Gabriel de Gabrieli) and the church St. Maria de Victoria, which was built by the [[Asam brothers]] (1732–1736). The church of the Augustinians of [[Johann Michael Fischer]] (1736) was completely destroyed in World War II.
[[File:Ingolstadt town hall.jpg|thumb|240px|Ingolstadt town hall]]
Many buildings of the neo-classical fortification of [[Leo von Klenze]] have been preserved, such as the ''Reduit Tilly'' and the towers ''Baur'' and ''Triva''.

As well as being the home of the headquarters of the car manufacturer [[Audi]], the town is also home to Audi's [[museum mobile]], which is open to the public and presents historic exhibits and offers guided tours.

===Parks and natural areas===
Ingolstadt is a green city with numerous parks, green spaces and forests. The most prominent of these is the "[[Glacis]]", formerly an open space in front of the city walls, now surrounding the historic city centre. It functions as a "green belt" and a buffer area between traffic, residential areas and schools. It is possible to traverse it using spacious paths for pedestrians and cyclists, with a good view of the site of the former fortifications, including a well-preserved section of the ditch. Spanning about {{cvt|50|acre}} of the Glacis is {{Interlanguage link|Klenzepark|de|vertical-align=sup}}, the biggest park in the city. It contained the former {{Interlanguage link|Ingolstadt State Fortress|WD=Q1572351|vertical-align=sup}} and was the site of the [[Landesgartenschau]] in 1992. Klenzepark is south of the Danube river, opposite the Ingolstadt old town. In the warm seasons, about 100,000 visitors use the park every month, mostly young people. While about 75% of the park visitors come from Ingolstadt and the surrounding area, the remaining approximately 25% travel from more distant places.{{Citation needed|date=February 2022}}

The biggest forest in Ingolstadt is the Auwald ("riverside forest", also called "Schüttel"). It is found on both the northern and southern banks of the Danube, and is one of the biggest well-preserved river forests in Germany, extending mainly from Neuburg to Ingolstadt with extensions to the city centre. The forest serves as a natural reserve, with parts containing unique vegetation or acting as a wildlife reserve.

The Danube river runs through Ingolstadt, flowing west to east. In the area of Ingolstadt, the Danube is between 80 and 100 metres wide and flows past Ingolstadt's old town.

==Literary references==
Ingolstadt is one of the many settings in Mary Shelley's novel ''[[Frankenstein]]''. Primarily, Victor Frankenstein attends university in Ingolstadt. It is also widely regarded as the place where the unnamed monster was created.

The [[Illuminati]] was founded in Ingolstadt and Shelley's husband, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], was sympathetic to the radical group's aim of freeing society from Christian influence. In 1810 as a student at Oxford he wrote to his friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg: “I burn with impatience for the moment of Xtianity’s dissolution<ref>{{Cite book |last=Holmes |first=Richard |title=Shelley: the pursuit |publisher=Penguin |year=1974 |isbn=0140580379 |location=London |pages=46 |language=English}}</ref>” and signed off with the Illuminati's catchphrase “Ecrasez l’imfame”.

The musical version of the novel, ''[[Frankenstein – A New Musical]]'' has many scenes set in Ingolstadt.

Ingolstadt is also a pivotal location in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]].

The sixth scene of "[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]" by "[[Bertolt Brecht]]" is set in Ingolstadt, when count Tilly died in 1632, during the "[[Thirty Years' War]]".

[[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]'s 1971 film [[Pioneers in Ingolstadt]] is set in the town.

''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "The Post-Modern Prometheus" makes a reference to the [[University of Ingolstadt]]. This was an allusion to ''Frankenstein'', as the episode contained numerous Frankenstein references, and the full title of ''Frankenstein'' is ''"Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus"''.
