'''Cebu City''', officially the '''City of Cebu''' ({{langx|ceb|Dakbayan sa Sugbo}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Central Visayas]] [[Regions of the Philippines|region]] of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 964,169 people,{{PH census|current}} making it the sixth-most populated city in the nation and the most populous in the [[Visayas]] and in Central Visayas Region.

It serves as the capital of [[Cebu]] wherein it is geographically situated and grouped under the province by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], but is one of three cities (together with [[Lapu-Lapu City|Lapu-Lapu]] and [[Mandaue]]) that are administratively independent of the provincial government and also the largest city of that province. It also serves as the regional center of [[Central Visayas]], and its [[Metro Cebu|metropolitan area]] exerts influence on commerce, trade, industry, education, culture, tourism, and healthcare beyond the region, over Central and Eastern [[Visayas]] and partly over [[Mindanao]]. It is the Philippines' main domestic shipping port and is home to about 80% of the country's domestic shipping companies. Additionally, Cebu City is the prime trading center of the southern Philippines.

Cebu City is bounded on the north by the town of [[Balamban, Cebu|Balamban]] and the city of [[Danao, Cebu|Danao]], on the west by the city of [[Toledo City, Cebu|Toledo]], on the east by the cities of [[Lapu-Lapu City|Lapu-Lapu]] and [[Mandaue]] and the towns of [[Liloan, Cebu|Liloan]], [[Consolacion]] and [[Compostela, Cebu|Compostela]] and to the south by the city of [[Talisay, Cebu|Talisay]]. Located at the center of the eastern seaboard of [[Cebu Island]], it is the core city of [[Metro Cebu]], the second largest [[metropolitan area]] in the Philippines, which includes the cities of [[Carcar]], Danao, Lapu-Lapu, Mandaue, [[Naga, Cebu|Naga]] and Talisay and the municipalities (towns) of Compostela, Consolacion, [[Cordova, Cebu|Cordova]], Liloan, [[Minglanilla]] and [[San Fernando, Cebu|San Fernando]]. Metro Cebu had a total population of 3,165,799 as of the 2020 census.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |date=May 19, 2016 |title=Highlights of the Philippine Population 2015 Census of Population |url=http://psa.gov.ph/content/highlights-philippine-population-2015-census-population |access-date=October 31, 2016 |website=Philippine Statistics Authority}}</ref>

The current political boundaries of the city are an incorporation of the former municipalities of Cebu, San Nicolas, El Pardo, Mabolo, Talamban and Banilad in the Commonwealth period.<ref name="Letigio">{{Cite news |last=Letigio |first=Delta Dyrecka |date=February 24, 2020 |title=The crowning of Cebu City, the Queen City of the South |work=CDN Digital |url=https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/289880/the-crowning-of-cebu-city-the-queen-city-of-the-south |access-date=August 17, 2020}}</ref>

The city has experienced rapid economic growth since the 1990s, a phenomenon also known as "[[Ceboom]]". Owing to its economic importance and influence in modern times, Cebu City is also popularly referred to as the ''Queen City of the South''.<ref name="Daily Guardian">{{cite news |title=A glimpse into Iloilo City's colorful past |url=https://thedailyguardian.net/opinion/a-glimpse-into-iloilo-citys-colorful-past/ |date=August 22, 2011 |access-date=March 25, 2023 |archive-date=April 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414153346/https://thedailyguardian.net/opinion/a-glimpse-into-iloilo-citys-colorful-past/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

It shows how the culture of the area was Hindu and [[Greater India|Indianized]].]]Very little is known about when the site was first settled prior to colonization, but artifacts have been discovered near the city, if not exactly at the site in what is now Cebu City dating back to at least the 14th to 15th centuries CE. Other geological and archaeological studies revealed that Cebu as a settlement began sometime during the 10th century CE.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Orillaneda |first=Bobby C. |date=2016-06-09 |title=Maritime Trade in the Philippines During the 15th Century CE |url=https://journals.openedition.org/moussons/3529?lang=en#:~:text=Historical%20and%20archaeological%20sources%20indicate,the%2016th%20century%20CE. |journal=Moussons.

The city's only reliable historical record started with Portuguese explorer, [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s landing in the island in 1521 CE and then after the [[Battle of Mactan]], it is then followed by a brief period of silence and almost nihility, and back again in 1565 CE when [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] led an expedition back to the island. When Magellan and crew arrived in 1521 CE, the Europeans did not mention or state a thriving city in a European or Chinese sense and nor it was ever been described as a "kingdom" as [[Precolonial barangay|there were no kingdoms]] in pre-colonial Philippines other than it was merely a simple fishing and trading village.<ref name=":1" /> However, this notion is challenged by a new translation of ancient Chinese Annals, a kingdom called ''Suwu''<ref name="Shao-yun">{{Cite web|url=https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/39bce63e4e0642d3abce6c24db470760|title=A Chinese Gazetteer of Foreign Lands|first=Shao-yun Yang (Department of History, Denison|last=University)|date=August 1, 2024|website=ArcGIS StoryMaps}}</ref> was mentioned in the 1225 Chinese Annals, the Zhufan Zhi (諸蕃志), and during the 17th Century this was the same name used for Cebu among Chinese traders to the Philippines, thus, it is presumed to be the same location.<ref name="CarmelaAng" />

Cebu was referenced in association with Boni ([[Brunei]]) wherein it was written:

On April 7, 1521, [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorer]] at the service of the Spanish Crown and leader of the first expedition to circumnavigate the world, [[Ferdinand Magellan]], landed in Cebu. He was welcomed by [[Rajah Humabon]]. Magellan, however, was killed in the [[Battle of Mactan]], and the remaining members of his expedition left Cebu soon after several of them were poisoned by Humabon, who was fearful of foreign occupation. The last ruler of Sugbo, prior to Spanish colonization, was Rajah Humabon's nephew, [[Rajah Tupas]] (d. 1565).<ref name=":3" />

On February 13, 1565, Spanish and (probably some) Mexican conquistadors led by [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] together with Augustinian friars whose prior was [[Andrés de Urdaneta]], left New Spain (modern Mexico) and arrived in Samar, taking possession of the island thereafter. They Christianized some natives and Spanish remnants in Cebu. Afterwards, the expedition visited [[Leyte]], [[San Juan, Southern Leyte|Cabalian]], Mazaua, [[Camiguin]] and [[Bohol]] where the famous ''[[Sandugo]]'' or blood compact was performed between López de Legazpi and [[Datu Sikatuna]], the chieftain of Bohol on March 16, 1565. The Spanish arrived in Cebu on April 15, 1565. They then attempted to parley with the local ruler, Rajah Tupas, but found that he and the local population had abandoned the town. Rajah Tupas presented himself at their camp on May 8, feast of the [[Michael (archangel)|Apparition of Saint Michael the Archangel]], when the island was taken possession of on behalf of the Spanish King. The [[Treaty of Cebu (1565)|Treaty of Cebu]] was formalized on July 3, 1565. López de Legazpi's party named the new city "Villa de San Miguel de Cebú" (later renamed "Ciudad del Santísimo Nombre de Jesús)." In 1567 the Cebu garrison was reinforced with the arrival of 2,100 soldiers from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] (Mexico).{{efn|1=On orders of the King Philip II, 2,100 men arrived from Mexico.<ref name="SpanishExpeditions">{{Cite web |date=2005 |title=Spanish Expeditions to the Philippines |url=http://www.philippine-history.org/spanish-expeditions.htm |website=philippine-history.org}}</ref>}} The growing colony was then fortified by [[Fort San Pedro]].

By 1569, the Spanish settlement in Cebu had become important as a safe port for ships from [[Mexico]] and as a jumping-off point for further exploration of the archipelago. Small expeditions led by [[Juan de Salcedo]] went to [[Mindoro]] and [[Luzon]], where he and [[Martín de Goiti]] played a leading role in the subjugation of the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tundun]] and [[Seludong]] in 1570. One year later, López de Legazpi departed Cebu to discuss a peace pact with the defeated Rajahs. An agreement between the conquistadors and the Rajahs to form a city council paved the way for the establishment of a new settlement and the construction of the Christian walled city of [[Intramuros]] on the razed remains of Islamic Manila, then a vassal-state of the [[Sultanate of Brunei]].

In 1571, the Spanish carried over infantry from Mexico, to raise an army of Christian Visayan warriors from [[Cebu]] and [[Iloilo]] as well as mercenaries from the Tagalog region and assaulted the Sultanate of Brunei in what is known as the [[Castilian War]]. The war also started the [[Spanish–Moro Wars]] waged between the Christian Visayans and Muslim Mindanao, wherein Moros burned towns and conducted slave raids in the Visayas islands and selling the slaves to the Sultanates of the [[Malay Archipelago]] and the Visayans fought back by establishing Christian fort-cities in Mindanao, cities such as [[Zamboanga City]].

These former towns were broken up into several barangays, including their town centers which assumed their names (in contrast, Manila and Iloilo preserved their incorporated towns as geo-political districts) resulting this in expansion of its territory.<ref name="Letigio"/> Many other Philippine cities such as Dansalan (now [[Marawi]]), [[Iloilo City]], and [[Bacolod]] were also incorporated at the same time (see [[Cities of the Philippines]]). Alfredo V. Jacinto was then serving as mayor when the city's status was restored by law.

====Japanese occupation====
Along with the rest of the country, Cebu came under [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] during [[World War II]]. The Japanese encountered opposition from guerrillas and irregular forces led by [[James M. Cushing|Col. James Cushing]] and the Cebu Area Command. A Japanese businessman established Cebu's first "comfort station" during the war, where Japanese soldiers routinely gang-raped, humiliated, and murdered kidnapped girls and teenagers who they forced into sexual slavery under the brutal "[[comfort women]]" system.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/29/939811000/philippine-survivor-recounts-her-struggle-as-a-comfort-woman-for-wartime-japan|title=Philippine Survivor Recounts Her Struggle As A 'Comfort Woman' For Wartime Japan|newspaper=NPR.org|publisher=NPR|access-date=15 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IsBB-RVTlQC&dq=comfort+gay+philippines+japan&pg=PR9|title=The Other Empire: Literary Views of Japan from the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia|year=2008|publisher=The University of the Philippines Press|isbn=9789715425629|access-date=15 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.awf.or.jp/e1/philippine-00.html | title=Women made to be Comfort Women – Philippines }}</ref> It was finally liberated with the [[Battle for Cebu City]] in March and April 1945. The military general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 8th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, active from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, was stationed in Cebu City during World War II.

===Post-war years===
[[File:Cebu City.jpg|thumb|left|Skyline of Uptown Cebu in 2009]]
The war virtually razed Cebu City to the ground. Reconstruction, however, was rapid. The city's central business district, which had been confined largely to the coast and the area around the port before the war, had expanded inland. [[Colon Street]], the oldest national road in the Philippines, which was once a residential area in the pre-war years, became the center of a dense and compact area in [[downtown]] Cebu City, becoming home to many shopping and business activities, including the city's most fashionable shops, restaurants, and movie houses. In 1962, construction of the Cebu City North Reclamation Area commenced, finishing eventually in 1969, which expanded the [[port of Cebu]] and provided the city with more developable land close to the city center. During this time, Cebu also became a prominent educational center for the Visayas and Mindanao regions, and new schools were established in Cebu's uptown areas, such as the Talamban campus of the [[University of San Carlos]].<ref>{{ cite web |title=Vol XII, No. 1 – Urban Expansion Through Land Reclamation.pdf |url=https://www.pssc.org.ph/wp-content/pssc-archives/Philippine%20Planning%20Journal/Vol%20XII,%20No.%201%20-%20Urban%20Expansion%20Through%20Land%20Reclamation.pdf |access-date=August 29, 2022 }}</ref>

Later, Cebu would play a key role in the days leading up to the 1986 [[People Power revolution]] and the ouster of Marcos. It was from Fuente Osmeña circle in Cebu City that the opposition forces relaunched a civil disobedience campaign against the Marcos regime and its cronies on February 22, 1986. After that, the Carmelite Monastery in Barangay Mabolo, Cebu City, served as a refuge for opposition candidates Aquino and Laurel during the first day of the People Power revolution, because it was not yet safe to go back to Manila.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Erram |first=Morexette Marie B. |date=February 25, 2021 |title=Cebu and the days leading to February 25, 1986 |language=en |work=Cebu Daily News |url=https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/365044/cebu-and-the-days-leading-to-the-edsa-people-power-revolution |access-date=March 3, 2021}}</ref>

===Economic boom and contemporary history===
[[File:Cebu Downtown CCLEX top view (Cebu City; 09-07-2022).jpg|thumb|The [[Cebu–Cordova Link Expressway]] (CCLEX), the longest sea-crossing bridge in the Philippines as of 2022, connects Cebu City to the municipality of [[Cordova, Cebu|Cordova]] in [[Mactan Island]].]]
In 1990, [[Typhoon Ruping]] (international name ''Mike'') hit [[Visayas]] and Cebu in particular, causing considerable damage to the infrastructure of the city and province. The typhoon cut off many of the city's communication lines, and was virtually cut from the outside, causing delays for aid from the national government in [[Manila]]. This forced local authorities to rethink governmental priorities, and enforced some radical measures, such as food, water, and fuel rations.<ref name="AP10">{{cite news|title=Local Officials Appeal for Government Help in Typhoon-Hit Areas|agency=Associated Press|date=November 15, 1990}} {{subscription required|via=Lexis Nexis}}</ref> However, the city quickly recovered, and by the end of the decade, it was experiencing rapid economic growth,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hutchinson|first1=Francis|title=Architects of Growth?: Sub-national Governments and Industrialization in Asia|date=2014|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wJzhAwAAQBAJ&q=Ceboom+typhoon&pg=PA59|isbn=9789814414531}}</ref> dubbed [[Ceboom]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/338753/has-ceboom-returned| title=Has 'Ceboom' returned?|first= Fernando|last=Fajardo|newspaper= Cebu Daily News |date=January 11, 2013 |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130113042653/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/338753/has-ceboom-returned| archive-date=January 13, 2013 |url-status=live |access-date=June 19, 2017 }}</ref> The economic growth of the city also spread economic growth to [[Metro Cebu|its neighboring cities and municipalities]], which spreads from [[Danao, Cebu|Danao]] from the north all the way to [[Carcar]] to the south.

Within the city, economic growth was observed in other areas as well, and much of the business activity shifted from the old and derelict downtown area to the more modern and more diverse business districts located in other areas of the city, including areas around [[Fuente Osmeña]] (colloquially known as "Uptown Cebu"), the [[Cebu Business Park]], and the [[Cebu IT Park]], among other areas. The opening of the aforementioned Ayala Mall and [[SM City Cebu]] had also shifted significant retail activities away from Colon, though it remained to serve as an important transit point for public utility [[jeepney]]s (PUJ) covering arterial routes within the city.

In 2002, the [[South Road Properties]] (SRP) was completed, initially with the intention of being a hub for [[light industries]] but gradually shifted to be a hub for [[mixed-use developments]]. The Cebu South Coastal Road, which traverses through SRP, has helped alleviate the city's traffic by serving as an alternative to the [[Natalio Bacalso Avenue]]. [[SM Seaside City Cebu]] opened in 2015, and was one of the [[List of largest shopping malls in the Philippines|largest shopping malls in the Philippines]] upon opening. The opening of the [[Cebu–Cordova Link Expressway]] in 2022, which links the city to [[Cordova, Cebu|Cordova]] in Mactan, is poised to unlock the SRP's potential as the city's next economic hub. Other infrastructure projects, such as the [[Metro Cebu Expressway]] and the [[Cebu Bus Rapid Transit System]], are also in place to help facilitate the city's future growth.<ref>{{ cite news |date=October 1, 2020 |title=Gullas sees 'Ceboom' repeat |url=https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1872084/cebu/local-news/gullas-sees-ceboom-repeat |work=[[SunStar Cebu]] |access-date=August 29, 2022 }}</ref>

[[File:Cebu City Hall (Plaza Sugbu, Cebu City; 01-21-2023).jpg|thumb|Cebu City Hall, the seat of city government.]]
Being a highly urbanized city, Cebu City (along with neighboring [[Mandaue]] and [[Lapu-Lapu, Philippines|Lapu-Lapu]]) is independent from Cebu province. Its electorate do not vote for provincial officials. There were proposals during the time of Governor [[Emilio Mario Osmeña]] to establish an "administrative district" that would be independent from Cebu City. This would mean carving out Cebu City's Capitol Site barangay, where the provincial capitol and other provincial offices are located. The plan, however, did not go through and was even followed by other proposals like the transfer of the capital to Balamban.

Cebu City is governed by a mayor, vice mayor and [[Cebu City Council|sixteen councilors]] (eight representing the north and eight representing the south districts). Each official is popularly elected to serve for a three-year term. The chief of the [[Association of Barangay Captains]] and the president of the [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] Federation also serve in the city council. The day-to-day administration of the city is handled by a city administrator.<ref>{{Cite news |date=October 10, 2008 |title=Davide is acting Cebu City mayor Osmeña in US, Rama off to Korea |work=Cebu Daily News (Inquirer.net) |url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081010-165704/Davide-is-acting-Cebu-City-mayor |url-status=dead |access-date=October 10, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011011530/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081010-165704/Davide-is-acting-Cebu-City-mayor |archive-date=October 11, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Osmeñas leave for US amid prayer |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081008-165293/Osmenas-leave-for-US-amid-prayers |url-status=dead |access-date=October 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011080249/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081008-165293/Osmenas-leave-for-US-amid-prayers |archive-date=October 11, 2008 }}</ref>

==Culture==
[[File:Interior of the Basilica del Santo Niño.jpg|thumb|left|Devotees inside the [[Basilica del Santo Niño]].]]
Cebu City is a significant cultural center in the Philippines. The imprint of Spanish and Roman Catholic culture is evident. The city's most famous landmark is [[Magellan's Cross]]. This cross, now housed in a chapel, is reputed to have been erected by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] (Fernão Magalhães) when he arrived in the Philippines in 1521.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cebú|volume=5|pages=592–593|noicon=yes}}</ref> It was encased in hollow [[Afzelia rhomboidea|tindalo wood]] in 1835 upon the order of the Augustinian Bishop Santos Gómez Marañon to prevent devotees from taking it home chip by chip. The same bishop restored the present template or kiosk, located at Magallanes Street between the City Hall and Colegio del Santo Niño. Revered by Filipinos, the Magellan's Cross is a symbol of Christianity in the Philippines.

A few steps away from Magellan's Cross is the [[Basilica Minore del Santo Niño]] (Church of the Holy Child). This is an Augustinian church elevated to the rank of basilica in 1965 during the 400th anniversary celebrations of Christianity in the Philippines, held in Cebu. The church, which was the first to be established in the islands, is built of hewn stone and features the country's oldest relic, the figure of the [[Santo Niño de Cebú]] (Holy Child of Cebu), who is [[Jesus Christ]] as a [[Child Jesus|Child]].
[[File:Viva Pit Senyor for Our Beloved Nation.jpg|thumb|[[Sinulog|Sinulog Festival]] is one of the grandest festival of the Philippines in honor of [[Santo Niño de Cebú|Senor Santo Niño]]]]
This religious and cultural event is celebrated during the island's cultural festivities known as the [[Sinulog festival]]. Held every third Sunday of January, it celebrates the festival of the [[Santo Niño de Cebú|Santo Niño]], who was formerly considered to be the patron saint of Cebu.{{cn|date=October 2024}} (This patronage was later changed to that of Our Lady of Guadalupe after it was realized that the Santo Niño could not be a patron saint because he was an image of Christ and not a saint.) The Sinulog is a dance prayer ritual of pre-Hispanic indigenous origin.{{cn|date=October 2024}} The dancer moves two steps forward and one step backward to the rhythmic sound of drums. This movement resembles somewhat the current (sulog) of the river. Thus, the Cebuanos called it Sinulog.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

When the Spaniards arrived in Cebu, the Italian chronicler [[Antonio Pigafetta]], sailing under convoy with the Magellan expedition, offered a baptismal gift to Hara Amihan, wife of Rajah Humabon. She was later named Juana, the figure of the Santo Niño. The natives also honored the Santo Niño de Cebú in their indigenous sinulog ritual.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} This ritual was preserved but limited to honoring the Santo Niño. Once the Santo Niño church was built in the 16th century, the Christianized-[[Malay race|Austronesian natives]] started performing the sinulog ritual in front of the church, the devotees offering candles and indigenous dancers shouting "Viva Pit Señor!"{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In the 1980s and 2000s, the city authorities of Cebu added the religious feast of Santo Niño de Cebú during the Sinulog Festival to its cultural event.

The city joined [[UNESCO]]'s [[Creative Cities Network|Network of Creative Cities]] as a Design City on October 31, 2019, on the occasion of World Cities' Day.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 30, 2019 |title=UNESCO celebrates World Cities Day designating 66 new Creative Cities |url=https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-celebrates-world-cities-day-designating-66-new-creative-cities |access-date=November 5, 2019 |website=UNESCO |language=en}}</ref> Cebu City was also recognized by the [[British Council]] as the Creative Capital of the Philippines.<ref>{{cite web |title=DOST Cebu Supports Cebu's Creative Sector |url=https://region7.dost.gov.ph/dost-cebu-supports-cebus-creative-sector/ |website=DOST Region VII |date=January 31, 2018 |publisher=DOST VII |access-date=August 6, 2021}}</ref> In 2019, it joined the UNESCO [[Creative Cities Network]] as a City of Design.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cebu City |url=https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/cebu-city |website=UNESCO Creative Cities Network |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=August 6, 2021}}</ref>

On Cebuano musical heritage, the [[Jose R. Gullas Halad Museum]] in V. Gullas St. (former Manalili) corner D. Jakosalem St. in Cebu City, holds musical memorabilia of Cebuano composers in the early 20th century, the likes of Ben Zubiri (composer of Matud Nila), Inting Rubi (Kasadya Ning Taknaa) and Minggoy Lopez (Rosas Pandan).

Since 2013, Cebu has hosted the [[Visayan Pop Songwriting Campaign]], an annual songwriting competition that aimed to showcase songs written in the Cebuano language. Founded by multi-awarded artist [[Jude Gitamondoc]], Ian Zafra, Cattski Espina, and [[Missing Filemon]]'s front-man Lorenzo Niñal through the Artists and Musicians Marketing Cooperative (ArtistKo) with the support of the Filipino Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. Vispop, or sometimes Visayan pop, later on evolved from being associated with the music festival to a genre of the new wave of Visayan pop songs that gained nationwide popularity, even those songs that were not exclusively produced for or presented in the contest.

There are also direct transfer flights via the capital's [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] that readily connect the city to other destinations in the world.

The city is served by a [[Port of Cebu|domestic and international port]] which are handled by the Cebu Port Authority. Much of the city's waterfront is actually occupied by the port with around {{convert|3.5|km|sp=us}} of berthing space. The city is home to more than 80% of the country's island vessels traveling on domestic routes mostly in the Visayas and Mindanao.<ref name="casestudy" />

Transportation throughout the city and the metropolitan itself is provided by [[jeepney]]s, buses and taxis.

Cebu City, and [[Metro Cebu]] as a whole, is an important educational hub in Southern Philippines. Cebu City itself is currently home to ten large universities each with a number of campuses throughout [[Cebu province]] and more than a dozen other schools specializing in various courses.

Among these schools is the [[University of San Carlos]], one of the most highly regarded educational institutions in the Philippines. It claims to trace its roots to [[Colegio de San Ildefonso]], which was founded in 1595. It has five campuses around Cebu City, including the Downtown Campus (formerly Main Campus) and the Talamban Campus (TC), both of which are home to the school's college programs. It is currently headed by the [[Society of the Divine Word]].

The [[University of the Philippines Cebu]], located at Barangay Camputhaw in the district near Lahug currently has eight courses and has plans of expansion and development. The U.P. Board of Regents elevated the status of U.P. Cebu as a constituent university of the University of the Philippines System on October 27, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |title=UP Cebu is now UP's 8th Constituent University |url=http://www.up.edu.ph/up-cebu-is-now-ups-8th-constituent-university/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128134535/http://www.up.edu.ph/up-cebu-is-now-ups-8th-constituent-university/ |archive-date=November 28, 2016 |access-date=March 19, 2017}}</ref>

Another Catholic university in Cebu City is the [[University of San Jose–Recoletos]] which was established in 1947.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History |url=http://www.usjredu.blogspot.com/p/history.html |access-date=April 27, 2013 |publisher=University of San Jose-Recoletos}}</ref> It is currently headed by the [[Augustinian Recollects]] and has two different campuses within the city, excluding a new campus outside the city located in the municipality of [[Balamban]].

[[Cebu Normal University]] (CNU) was established in 1902 as a provincial normal school, a branch of the Philippine Normal School. It became an independent institution in 1924, a chartered college in 1976, and a university in 1998. CNU offers academic programs at the nursery, kindergarten, elementary, junior high, undergraduate, and graduate levels. CNU is designated by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as Center of Excellence (COE) in both Nursing Education and Teacher Education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/List-of-COE-COD-as-of-May-2016.pdf|title=Table 8.

The [[Cebu Doctors' University]] (formerly Cebu Doctors' College) was granted university status in November 2004. It is the only private school in the Philippines to achieve university status without a designated basic education (pre-school&nbsp;– high school) curriculum; it caters mainly to courses related to the health services field. It was relocated to a nine-story building in 2007 at the Cebu Boardwalk (now Dr. P.V. Larrazabal Jr. Avenue) in neighboring city of [[Mandaue]], thus closing its old campus near the then Cebu Doctors' Hospital (now [[Cebu Doctors' University Hospital]]). {{As of| 2016}}, the university now offers senior high school (grades 11 and 12)

The [[University of Cebu]] (UC) has four campuses located within the city: Its main campus, located in Sanciangko Street, offers degree programs such as a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), HRM, Computer Engineering, BSED and others. The Maritime Education & Training Center (METC), located in Barangay Mambaling, which hosts the university's maritime programs, was opened in 1991. Its third campus, in Barangay Banilad, was opened in June 2002. A fourth campus, the Pardo–Talisay campus, located in Barangay Bulacao Pardo, near the boundary between Cebu City and [[Talisay, Cebu|Talisay]], was added to the UC network in 2021 after the university's acquisition of St. Paul College Foundation, Inc.

Also located in the city is the [[University of the Visayas]], established in 1919, and is considered to be the first educational institution in Cebu which was granted with a university status. It was granted an autonomous status by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) in 2010 and currently offers basic education and a number of courses in the tertiary level including medical courses (Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Midwifery, and Health Care Services) which are housed in its campus in Banilad area. Aside from its campuses within Cebu City, it also has numerous campuses located around the [[Cebu|province of Cebu]].

Other noteworthy institutions in the city include the [[Cebu Institute of Technology – University]] (formerly Cebu Institute of Technology), the main campus of [[Cebu Technological University (CTU)|Cebu Technological University]] (formerly the Cebu State College of Science and Technology), [[Southwestern University (Philippines)|Southwestern University]], [[University of Southern Philippines Foundation]] in Lahug and Mabini, [[Asian College of Technology]] (formerly Asian Computer Institute), Benedicto College, [[Cebu Eastern College]], [[Cebu International School]], [[Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion]], [[College of Technological Sciences - Cebu]], [[Don Bosco Technical College–Cebu]] (DBTC), [[Saint Theresa's College of Cebu]], [[Sacred Heart School - Ateneo de Cebu]], [[Salazar Colleges of Science and Institute of Technology]], and [[Velez College]] (together with its independently administered medical school arm [[Cebu Institute of Medicine]]), among others.

Cebu City has 68 public elementary schools, 23 national high schools and 28 night high schools. These night high schools are operated by the city government.

The [[Cebu City Public Library|Cebu City Public Library and Information Center]] is the only public library in Cebu.
