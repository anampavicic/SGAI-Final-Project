'''Kolwezi''' or '''Kolwesi''' is the capital [[Cities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|city]] of [[Lualaba Province]] in the south of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], west of [[Likasi]].  It has an airport and a railway to [[Lubumbashi]].  Just outside of Kolwezi there is the [[static inverter plant]] of the [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] [[Inga-Shaba]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dalarnastidningar.se/nyheter/ludvika/article222591.ece |title=Dalarnas Tidningar – Ludvika<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=14 December 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120723144746/http://www.dalarnastidningar.se/nyheter/ludvika/article222591.ece |archive-date=23 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  The population is approximately 573,000.

Before the creation of Lualaba province in 2015 Kolwezi had two territories attached to it and the whole was known as the '''Kolwezi District'''.

==History==
The settlement was created in 1938 to be the headquarters for the western mining group of the ''[[Union Minière du Haut Katanga]]''.  In 1971 it obtained city status and consisted of the communes of [[Dilala]] and [[Manika, Kolwezi|Manika]].  In 1976 the territories of [[Lubudi Territory|Lubudi]] and [[Mutshatsha Territory|Mutshatsha]], both previously part of [[Lualaba District]], were attached to it to form the Kolwezi District (districts were called sub-regions at the time).  In the [[Subdivisions of the DR Congo#New provinces|2015 repartitioning]] this was undone, the two territories and the city proper became separate parts of Lualaba province with the city as capital of the new province.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Kumwimba Musao |first=Joseph |date=2009 |title=La problématique de l'exploitation minière artisanale dans la province du Katanga (cas du district de Kolwezi) |type=Licence en sociologie industrielle |publisher=Institut Supérieur d'Etudes Sociales |at=2<sup>e</sup> partie, chap.

===Battle of Kolwezi (1978)===
{{main article|Battle of Kolwezi}}
On Saturday, 13 May 1978, ex-[[State of Katanga|Katangese]] soldiers supported by [[Angola]] occupied the city. The government of [[Zaire]] asked [[Belgium]], France, [[Morocco]] and the United States to restore order. The [[2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment|2e REP]], an elite [[paratrooper]]s unit of the [[French Foreign Legion]], were sent in to drive out the rebels and rescue any hostages. The [[Belgian army]] also deployed a force of some 750 [[Paracommando Brigade (Belgium)|Paracommando Regiment]] paratroopers and moved out just over 1,800 Europeans to other cities in the region.  700 Africans, including 250 rebels,<ref>Général Gaussères.

==Orientation==
Kolwezi is set on an arid plain in the south of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Upon its establishment in 1937 by the Union Minière du Haut-Katangahe, the company cleared the land of the acacias and miombo trees that once grew atop Kolwezi’s rich mineral deposits. They subsequently built a simple low-rise town across the area’s rolling hills, with wide streets and bungalows for Europeans, whose neighborhoods were segregated from the poorly built ones where Congolese workers lived. 

The N39 highway runs through the center of town on a northwest-southeast axis. Large open pit cobalt mines are located to the west and north of the city center. Rond Point de L'Indépendance is the traditional center of the city with more formally laid out neighborhoods located to the west of the traffic circle. The center of the city contains administrative offices, dozens of guesthouses and hotels, banks and restaurants. Mutoshi Technical Institute is located on the eastern edge of the city. Kolwezi has several medical clinics and hospitals along with dozens of primary and secondary schools. 

===Dilala===
Is an upscale neighborhood located in the center of Kolwezi. The area is home to several foreign workers and a number of guest houses. Manika Stadium is located in the Dilala neighborhood. Kolwezi's Central Train Station is located on the eastern edge of the neighborhood with train service to [[Likasi]] and [[Lubumbashi]].

Kolwezi is an important mining centre for copper and [[cobalt]]. There are also [[uranium]], [[radium]], [[oxide]] ores, and [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] deposits.
The [[Musonoi mine]] is a set of open-cut pits near Kolwezi from which copper and other metals have been extracted since the 1940s.<ref name=Mindat>{{cite web

 }}</ref> Kolwezi and its [[cobalt]] mining economy was profiled in the May 24, 2021 edition of [[The New Yorker]] by writer Nicolas Niarchos. The acute financial and environmental impacts on the city and its economy were highlighted in the article. The rapid growth of the [[cobalt]] mining industry has caused a recent surge in the city's population.

The city has a dry-winter humid subtropical climate (Cwa, according to the Köppen climate classification), with warm rainy summers and pleasant, dry winters, with most rainfall occurring during summer and early autumn.
