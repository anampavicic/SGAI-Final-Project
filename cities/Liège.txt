The city is situated in the valley of the [[Meuse]], in the east of Belgium, not far from borders with the [[Netherlands]] ([[Maastricht]] is about {{convert|33|km|1|abbr=on}} to the north) and with [[Germany]] ([[Aachen]] is about {{convert|53|km|1|abbr=on}} north-east). In Liège, the Meuse meets the river [[Ourthe]]. The city is part of the ''[[sillon industriel]]'', the former industrial backbone of Wallonia. It still is the principal economic and cultural centre of the region.

The [[municipality]] consists of the following [[Deelgemeente|sub-municipalities]]: [[Angleur]], [[Bressoux]], [[Chênée]], [[Glain]], [[Grivegnée]], [[Jupille-sur-Meuse]], Liège proper, [[Rocourt, Liège|Rocourt]], and [[Wandre]]. In November 2012, Liège had 198,280 inhabitants.

== Etymology ==
The name is of Germanic origin and is reconstructible as *''liudik-'', from the Germanic word *''liudiz'' "people", which is found in for example Dutch ''lui(den)'', ''lieden'', Polish "ludzie", Czech "lidé",  German ''Leute'', [[Old English]] ''lēod'' (English ''[[wikt:lede|lede]]''), Icelandic ''lýður'' ("people"), Latvian ''ļaudis'' ("people"), Lithuanian ''liaudis'' ("people"). It is found in Ukrainian as ''liudy'' ("people"), in Russian as russian: люди, romanised: ''liudi'' ("people"), in Latin as ''Leodicum'' or ''Leodium'', in Middle Dutch as ''ludic'' or ''ludeke''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gtb.inl.nl/iWDB/search?actie=article&wdb=VMNW&id=ID51802 |title=Ludike – Vroegmiddelnederlands woordenboek |access-date=8 July 2012 |language=nl}}</ref>

Until 17 September 1946, the city's name was written {{lang|fr|Liége}}, with the [[acute accent]] instead of a [[grave accent]].{{why|reason=Why was the accent originally acute and/or why was it changed?|date=October 2024}}<ref>''The Book Collector''.

In French, Liège is associated with the epithet ''la cité ardente'' ("the fervent city"). This term, which emerged around 1905, originally referred to the city's history of rebellions against Burgundian rule, but was appropriated to refer to its economic dynamism during the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web |title=D'où vient " Cité Ardente ", le surnom de la ville de Liège |url=https://be.ambafrance.org/D-ou-vient-Cite-Ardente-le-surnom |website=La France en Belgique |publisher=Embassy of France |access-date=30 May 2018 |language=fr}}</ref>

== History ==
{{For timeline}}

=== Early Middle Ages ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Although settlements already existed in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, the first references to Liège are from 558, when it was known as Vicus Leudicus. Around 705, [[Lambert of Maastricht|Saint Lambert of Maastricht]] is credited with completing the [[Christianization]] of the region, indicating that up to the early 8th century the religious practices of antiquity had survived in some form. [[Conversion to Christianity|Christian conversion]] may still not have been quite universal, since Lambert was murdered in Liège and thereafter regarded as a [[Christian martyr|martyr]] for his faith. To enshrine St. Lambert's [[relic]]s, his successor, [[Hubertus]] (later to become St. Hubert), built a [[basilica]] near the bishop's residence which became the true nucleus of the city.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

A few centuries later, the city became the capital of a [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège|prince-bishopric]], which lasted from 985 till 1794. The first [[prince-bishop]], [[Notker of Liège|Notger]], transformed the city into a major intellectual and ecclesiastical centre, which maintained its cultural importance during the [[Middle Ages]]. Pope [[Clement VI]] recruited several musicians from Liège to perform in the Papal court at [[Avignon]], thereby sanctioning the practice of [[polyphony]] in the religious realm. The city was renowned for its many churches, the oldest of which, St Martin's, dates from 682. Although nominally part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], in practice it possessed a large degree of independence.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

=== Late medieval and early modern periods ===
[[File:Map liege 1.jpg|thumb|Liège in 1650]]
{{See also|Prince-Bishopric of Liège}}
The strategic position of Liège has made it a frequent target of armies and insurgencies over the centuries. It was fortified early on with a castle on the steep hill that overlooks the city's western side. During this medieval period, three women from the Liège region made significant contributions to Christian spirituality: Elizabeth Spaakbeek, [[Christina the Astonishing]], and [[Marie of Oignies]].<ref>Brown, Jennifer N. Three women of Liège : a critical edition of and commentary on the Middle English lives of Elizabeth of Spalbeek, Christina Mirabilis and Marie d'Oignies. Turnhout: Brepols, 2008.</ref>

In 1345, the citizens of Liège rebelled against Prince-Bishop [[Engelbert III de la Marck]], their ruler at the time, and defeated him in battle near the city. Shortly after, a unique political system formed in Liège, whereby the city's 32 [[guild]]s shared sole political control of the municipal government. Each person on the register of each guild was eligible to participate, and each guild's voice was equal, making it the most democratic system that the [[Low Countries]] had ever known. The system spread to [[Utrecht]], and left a democratic spirit in Liège that survived the Middle Ages.<ref>

At the end of the [[Liège Wars]], a rebellion took place against rule from [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]]. In 1468 Duke [[Charles the Bold]] of Burgundy, witnessed by King [[Louis XI of France]], captured and largely destroyed the city after a bitter siege which was ended with a successful surprise attack. The rebellion figures prominently in the plot of [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]'s 1823 novel ''[[Quentin Durward]]''.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

The [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]] was technically part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] which, after 1477, came under the rule of the [[Habsburg]]s. The reign of prince-bishop [[Érard de La Marck]] (1506–1538) coincides with the dawn of the [[Renaissance]].{{cn|date=March 2023}}

During the [[Counter-Reformation]], the diocese of Liège was split and progressively lost its role as a regional power. By the 17th century, the bishopric of Liège became a virtual [[Secundogeniture]] of the Bavarian royal house of [[Wittelsbach]], with second sons of the Bavarian monarch ruling as prince-bishop. Beginning with the ascension of [[Ernest of Bavaria]] in 1581, Bavarian princes ruled over [[Cologne]], [[Münster]], and other bishoprics in the northwest of the Holy Roman Empire in addition to Liège. [[Ferdinand of Bavaria (bishop)]] ruled from 1612 to 1650, and [[Maximilian Henry of Bavaria]] ruled from 1650 to 1688.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

In 1636, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], the city was besieged by Imperial forces under [[Johann von Werth]] from April to July. The army, mainly consisting of mercenaries, extensively and viciously plundered the surrounding bishopric during the siege.<ref>Helfferich, Tryntje, The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History (Cambridge, 2009), pp. 292.</ref>

=== 18th century to World War I ===
[[File:Liege-Blaeu-00.jpg|thumb|left|Liège in 1627]]
The [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] captured the city from the Bavarian prince-bishop and his French allies in 1704 during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the middle of the eighteenth century the ideas of the French ''[[Encyclopédistes]]'' began to gain popularity in the region. Bishop [[François-Charles de Velbrück]] (1772–84), encouraged their propagation, thus prepared the way for the [[Liège Revolution]] which started in the episcopal city on 18 August 1789 and led to the creation of the [[Republic of Liège]] before it was invaded by counter-revolutionary forces of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] in 1791.

In the course of the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|1794 campaigns of the French Revolution]], the [[French Revolutionary Army]] took the city and imposed strongly anticlerical regime, destroying [[St. Lambert's Cathedral, Liège|St. Lambert's Cathedral]]. The overthrow of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]] was confirmed in 1801 by the [[Concordat of 1801|Concordat]] co-signed by [[Napoléon Bonaparte]] and [[Pope Pius VII]]. France lost the city in 1815 when the [[Congress of Vienna]] awarded it to the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Dutch rule lasted only until 1830, when the [[Belgian Revolution]] led to the establishment of an independent, Catholic and neutral Belgium which incorporated Liège. After this, Liège developed rapidly into a major industrial city which became one of continental Europe's first large-scale steel making centres. The [[Walloon Jacquerie of 1886]] saw a large-scale working class revolt.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/03/26/103955593.pdf|title=The New York Times, Published 25 March 1886|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=3 November 2018}}</ref> No less than 6,000 regular troops were called into the city to quell the unrest,<ref>See ''The New York Times'', published 23 March 1886</ref> while strike spread through the whole [[sillon industriel]].

[[File:Henri Georges- Quai de la Goffe, Liege (1).tif|thumb|Quai de la Goffe]]
[[Fortified Position of Liège|Liège's fortifications]] were redesigned by [[Henri Alexis Brialmont]] in the 1880s and a [[Fortified Position of Liège|chain of twelve forts]] was constructed around the city to provide [[defence in depth]]. This presented a major obstacle to the [[Imperial German Army]] in 1914, whose [[Schlieffen Plan]] relied on being able to quickly pass through the Meuse valley and the [[Ardennes]] en route to France. The [[German invasion of Belgium (1914)|German invasion of Belgium]] on 5 August 1914 soon reached Liège, which was defended by 30,000 troops under General [[Gérard Leman]] in the [[Battle of Liège]]. The forts initially held off General [[Alexander von Kluck]]'s [[1st Army (German Empire)|German First Army]] of about 100,000 men but were pulverised into submission by a five-day bombardment by heavy artillery, including thirty-two 21&nbsp;cm mortars and two German 42&nbsp;cm [[Big Bertha (Howitzer)|Big Bertha]] [[howitzer]]s.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Robson |first=Stuart |url=http://archive.org/details/firstworldwar0000robs_r5x1 |title=The First World War |date=2007 |publisher=Pearson Longman |others=Internet Archive |isbn=978-1-4058-2471-2 |edition=1 |location=Harrow, England |pages=14 |language=en |ref=none}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Robson |first=Stuart |url=http://archive.org/details/firstworldwar0000robs_r5x1 |title=The First World War |date=2007 |publisher=Pearson Longman |others=Internet Archive |isbn=978-1-4058-2471-2 |edition=1 |location=Harrow, England |pages=7 |language=en |ref=none}}</ref> Due to faulty planning of the protection of the underground defence tunnels beneath the main citadel, one direct artillery hit caused a huge explosion, which eventually led to the surrender of the Belgian forces. The Belgian resistance was shorter than had been intended, but the twelve days of delay caused by the siege nonetheless contributed to the eventual failure of the German invasion of France. The city was subsequently occupied by the Germans until the end of the war. Liège received the [[Légion d'Honneur]] for its resistance in 1914.

As part of Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg]]'s [[Septemberprogramm]], Berlin planned to annexe Liege under the name Lüttich to the [[German Empire]] in any post-war peace agreement.<ref>Watson, Alexander. ''Ring of Steel: Germany and Austria-Hungary at War, 1914-1918''. Penguin, 2014. p.258-59</ref>

=== World War II to the present ===
[[File:Inauguration de la statue de Charlemagne à Liège.jpg|thumb|Inauguration of the statue of Charlemagne, 26 July 1868]]
The [[German invasion of Belgium (1940)|Germans returned in 1940]], this time taking the forts in only three days. Most [[History of the Jews in Belgium|Jews]] were saved, with the help of the sympathetic population, as many Jewish children and refugees were hidden in the numerous monasteries. [[Liberation of Belgium|Liege was liberated]] by the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]] in September 1944.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_rxdDgAAQBAJ&q=%22liberated+by+British+troops%22&pg=PT273 | title=World War 2 in Review: A Primer| isbn=9781365797620| last1=Merriam| first1=Ray| date=2017-03-06| publisher=Lulu.com}}</ref>

After the war ended, the [[Royal Question]] came to the fore, since many saw King [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] as collaborating with the Germans during the war. In July 1950, [[André Renard]], leader of the [[General Federation of Belgian Labour|Liègian FGTB]] launched the [[General strike against Leopold III of Belgium]] and "seized control over the city of Liège".<ref>Erik Jones, Economic Adjustment and Political Transformation in Small States, Oxford Press, 2008, p. 121 978-0-19-920833-3</ref> The strike ultimately led to Leopold's abdication.

Liège began to suffer from a relative decline of its industry, particularly the coal industry, and later the steel industry, producing high levels of unemployment and stoking social tension. During the [[1960-1961 Winter General Strike]], disgruntled workers went on a rampage and severely damaged the central railway station Guillemins. The unrest was so intense that "army troops had to wade through [[caltrop]]s, trees, concrete blocks, car and crane wrecks to advance. Streets were dug up. Liège saw the worst fighting on 6 January 1961. In all, 75 people were injured during seven hours of street battles."<ref>''Political History of Belgium: From 1830 Onwards'', Academic and Scientific Publishers, Brussels, 2009, p. 278. {{ISBN|978-90-5487-517-8}}</ref>

On 6 December 1985, the city's courthouse was heavily damaged and one person was killed in a [[1985 Liège bombing|bomb attack by a lawyer]].

Liège is also known as a traditionally [[socialism|socialist]] city. In 1991, powerful Socialist [[André Cools]], a former Deputy Prime Minister, was gunned down in front of his girlfriend's apartment. Many suspected that the assassination was related to a corruption scandal which swept the [[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|Socialist Party]], and the [[Federal Government of Belgium|Belgian Federal Government]] in general, after Cools' death. Two men were sentenced to twenty years in jail in 2004, for involvement in Cools' murder.

Liège has shown some signs of economic recovery in recent years with the opening up of borders within the [[European Union]], surging steel prices, and improved administration.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} Several new shopping centres have been built, and numerous repairs carried out.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

On 13 December 2011, there was a [[2011 Liège attack|grenade and gun attack]] at [[Place Saint-Lambert]]. An attacker, later identified as Nordine Amrani, aged 33, armed with grenades and an assault rifle, attacked people waiting at a bus stop. There were six fatalities, including the attacker (who shot himself), and 123 people were injured.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/belgian-grenade-attack-leaves-5-dead-122-injured-1.1014658|title=Belgian grenade attack leaves 4 dead, 123 injured | work=CBC News | date=14 December 2011}}</ref>

On 29 May 2018, two female police officers and one civilian—a 22-year-old man—were [[2018 Liège attack|shot dead by a gunman]] near a café on Boulevard d'Avroy in central Liège. The attacker then began firing at the officers in an attempt to escape, injuring a number of them "around their legs", before he was shot dead. Belgian broadcaster [[RTBF]] said the gunman was temporarily released from prison on 28 May where he had been serving time on drug offences. The incident is currently being treated as terrorism.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44289404|title=Liege shooting: Two police officers and civilian dead in Belgium | work=BBC News | date=29 May 2018}}</ref>

== Climate ==
In spite of its inland position Liège has a [[oceanic climate|maritime climate]] influenced by the mildening sea winds originating from the [[Gulf Stream]], travelling over Belgium's interior. As a result, Liège has very mild winters for its latitude and inland position, especially compared to areas in the [[Russian Far East]] and the fellow Francophone province of [[Quebec]]. Summers are also moderated by the maritime air, with average temperatures being similar to areas as far north as in [[Scandinavia]]. Being inland though, Liège has a relatively low winter [[seasonal lag]].

[[File:Tchantches2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|upright|Traditional Liègian puppets]]
The "Le Quinze Août" celebration takes place annually on 15 August in Outremeuse and celebrates the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. It is one of the biggest folkloric displays in the city, with a religious procession, a flea market, dances, concerts, and a series of popular games. Nowadays these celebrations start a few days earlier and last until the 16th. Some citizens open their doors to party goers, and serve "peket", the traditional local alcohol. This tradition is linked to the important folkloric character ''Tchantchès'' ([[Walloon language|Walloon]] for ''François''), a hard-headed but resourceful [[Walloons|Walloon]] boy who lived during [[Charlemagne]]'s times. ''Tchantchès'' is remembered with a statue, a museum, and a number of puppets found all over the city.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

Liège is the most important city of the Walloon region from an economic perspective. In the past, Liège was one of the most important industrial centres in Europe, particularly in [[steel]]-making. Starting in 1817, [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]] extensively developed the iron and steel industry. The industrial complex of [[Seraing]] was the largest in the world. It once boasted numerous [[blast furnace]]s and mills. Liège has also been an important centre for [[gunsmithing]] since the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[arms industry]] is still strong today, with the headquarters of [[FN Herstal]] and [[Cockerill Maintenance & Ingénierie|CMI Defence]] being located in Liège. Although from 1960 on the [[secondary sector]] is going down and now is a mere shadow of its former self, the manufacture of steel goods remain important.

The economy of the region is now diversified; the most important centres are: Mechanical industries ([[Aircraft engine]] and [[Spacecraft propulsion]]), space technology, [[information technology]], [[biotechnology]] and the production of [[water]], [[beer]] or [[chocolate]]. Liège has an important group of headquarters dedicated to high-technology, such as [[Safran|Techspace Aero]], which manufactures pieces for the [[Airbus A380]] or the rocket [[Ariane 5]]. Other stand-out sectors include [[Amós]] which manufactures optical components for [[telescope]]s and [[Drytec]], which produces compressed air dryers. Liège also has many other electronic companies such as [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[EVS Broadcast Equipment|EVS]], [[Gillam (company)|Gillam]], [[AnB]], [[Balteau]], [[IP Trade]]. Other prominent businesses are the global leader in light armament [[FN Herstal]], the [[beer]] company [[Jupiler]], the chocolate company [[Galler]], and the water and soda companies [[Spa (mineral water)|Spa]] and [[Chaudfontaine]]. A science park south east of the city, near the University of Liège campus, houses [[Research spin-off|spin-offs]] and high technology businesses.

=== 1812 mine accident ===
In 1812 there were three coal pits (''Bure'') in close proximity just outside the city gates: Bure Triquenotte, Bure de Beaujone and Bure Mamonster.  The first two shafts were joined underground, but the last one was a separate colliery.  The shafts were {{convert|120|fathom}} deep.  Water was led to a sump (''serrement'') from which it could be pumped to the surface.  At 11:00 on 28 February 1812 the sump in the Beaujone mine failed and flooded the entire colliery.  Of the 127 men down the mine at the time 35 escaped by the main shaft, but 74 were trapped.  [These numbers are taken from the report, the 18 miner discrepancy is unexplained.] The trapped men attempted to dig a passageway into Mamonster.  After {{convert|23|feet}} there was a [[firedamp]] explosion and they realised that they had penetrated some old workings belonging to an abandoned mine, Martin Wery.  The overseer, Monsieur Goffin, led the men to the point in Martin Wery which he judged closest to Mamonster and they commence to dig.  By the second day they had run out of candles and dug the remainder of a {{convert|36|feet}} gallery in darkness.

On the surface the only possible rescue was held to be via Mamonster.  A heading was driven towards Beaujone with all possible speed, including blasting.  The trapped miners heard the rescuers and vice versa.  Five days after the accident communication was possible and the rescuers worked in darkness to avoid the risk of a firedamp explosion.  By 7pm that evening an opening was made, {{convert|511|feet}} of tunnel had been dug by hand in five days.  All of the 74 miners in Goffin's part survived and were brought to the surface.<ref>{{citation | title = Account of an Accident which happened in a Coal-Mine at Liège in 1812 | last = Thomson | first = Thomas | author-link = Thomas Thomson (chemist) | work = [[Annals of Philosophy]] | volume = VII | date = April 1816 | issue = XL | publisher = Robert Baldwin | place = London | at = pp 260 – 263 | url = https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/54029#page/282/mode/1up | access-date = 28 December 2014 }}</ref>

== Transport ==
=== Air ===

Liège is served by [[Liège Airport]], located in Bierset, a few kilometres west of the city.  It is the principal axis for the delivery of freight and in 2011 was the world's 33rd busiest cargo airport.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCurry|first=John|title=The world's top 50 airports|url=http://www.aircargoworld.com/Air-Cargo-News/2011/08/the-worlds-top-50-airports/251575|publisher=Air Cargo News|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127172439/http://www.aircargoworld.com/Air-Cargo-News/2011/08/the-worlds-top-50-airports/251575|archive-date=27 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Passenger services are very few. It is owned by the [[Wallonia|Walloon]] government along with some private investors.

=== Maritime ===
The [[Port of Liège]], located on the river [[Meuse]], is the 3rd largest [[river port]] in Europe. Liège also has direct links to [[Antwerp]] through the [[Albert Canal]] and to Rotterdam via the river Meuse. It stretches over a distance of 26 kilometres and comprises 32 port areas and covers 3.7 square kilometres.

=== Rail ===
Liège is served by many direct rail links with the rest of Western Europe.  Its three principal stations are [[Liège-Guillemins railway station]], Liège-Carré, and Liège-Saint-Lambert.  The [[InterCity Express]] and [[Thalys]] call at Liège-Guillemins, providing direct connections to [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt]] and [[Paris-Nord]] respectively.

Liège was once home to a network of [[Trams in Liège|trams]]. However, they were removed by 1967 in favour of the construction of a new metro system. A prototype of the metro was built and a tunnel was dug underneath the city, but the metro was never built. The construction of a new modern tramway has been ordered and was once scheduled to open by 2017; however the first rails were only laid in April 2021.<ref>https://letram.be/actualites/pose-des-premiers-rails-rue-leopold-retour-sur-levenement/ Tramoperator's website</ref>

=== Road ===
Liège sits at the crossroads of a number of highways including the [[European route E25]], the [[European route E42|European Route E42]], the [[European route E40|European Route E40]] and the [[European route E313|European Route E313]].
