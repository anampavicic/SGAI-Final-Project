Historic Helsingborg, with its many old buildings, is a scenic coastal city. The buildings are a blend of old-style stone-built churches and a 600-year-old medieval fortress ([[Kärnan]]) in the city centre, and more modern commercial buildings. The streets vary from wide avenues to small alley-ways. ''Kullagatan'', the main pedestrian shopping street in the city, was the first pedestrian shopping street in Sweden.

==History==
Helsingborg is one of the oldest cities of what is now Sweden. It has been the site of permanent settlement officially since 21 May 1085.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.helsingborg.se/templates/StandardPage.aspx?id=549&epslanguage=EN |title=Helsingborgs stad – History of Helsingborg |publisher=Helsingborg.se |date=21 May 2007 |access-date=30 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808165355/http://helsingborg.se/templates/StandardPage.aspx?id=549 |archive-date=8 August 2007 }}</ref> Helsingborg's geographical position at the narrowest part of [[Øresund]] made it very important for [[Denmark]], at that time controlling both sides of that strait. From 1429 [[Eric of Pomerania]] introduced the [[Sound Dues]], a [[Tax|levy]] on all trading vessels passing ''through'' the sound between Helsingør and Helsingborg.<ref>Faringdon, Hugh. (1989) ''Strategic Geography'' Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-00980-4}}</ref> This was one of the main sources of income for the Danish Crown. Crossing traffic, like fishermen, were not subject to the tax, which was initially directed against the [[Hanseatic League]].{{cn|date=November 2023}}[[File:Ser Reg Sueciae Aduentus Helsingburgi (cropped).jpg|thumb|left]]Following the [[Dano-Swedish War (1657–1658)]] and the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] Denmark had to give up all territory on the southern [[Scandinavian peninsula]], and Helsingborg became part of Sweden. King [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] landed here on 5 March 1658 to take personal possession of the [[Scanian lands]] and was met by a delegation led by the [[bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Lund]], [[Peder Winstrup]]. At that time the town had a population of barely 1,000 people.<ref name="historia1">{{cite web |url=http://www2.historia.su.se/urbanhistory/cybcity/stad/helsingborg/befolkning.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041115172801/http://www.historia.su.se/urbanhistory/cybcity/stad/helsingborg/befolkning.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 November 2004 |title=CyberCity / Helsingborg / Befolkning |publisher=.historia.su.se |date=14 January 2008 |access-date=30 July 2010 }}</ref>

Its situation on a conflict-ridden border caused problems for Helsingborg. Denmark recaptured [[Scania]] twice, but could not hold it. The last Danish attempt to regain Scania was in 1710, when 14,000 men landed on the shores near Helsingborg. The [[Battle of Helsingborg (1710)|Battle of Helsingborg]] was fought on 10 March just outside the city, which was badly affected. It took a long time to recover; even in 1770 the city had only 1,321 inhabitants and was still growing slowly.<ref name="historia1"/>

On 20 October 1811, [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], [[Marshal of France]] and [[president-elect|crown prince-elect]] of Sweden (later King Charles XIV John) took his first step on Swedish soil in Helsingborg on his journey from Paris to [[Stockholm]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.helsingborg.se/templates/StandardPage.aspx?id=80759&epslanguage=SV |title=Helsingborgs stad – Bernadotte jubileum 2010 |publisher=Helsingborg.se |date=12 April 2010 |access-date=30 July 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

From the middle of the 19th century onwards, Helsingborg was one of the fastest-growing cities of Sweden, increasing its population from 4,000 in 1850 to 20,000 in 1890 and 56,000 in 1930 due to industrialization.{{cn|date=November 2023}} From 1892, a [[train ferry]] was put in service, connecting Helsingborg with its Danish sister city [[Helsingør]]. A [[trams|tramway]] network was inaugurated in 1903 and closed down in 1967.{{cn|date=November 2023}}

Following the [[Swedish orthography]] reform of 1906, the spelling of many place names in Sweden was modernized. In 1912, it was decided to use the form ''Hälsingborg''. In preparation for the local government reform in 1971, Hälsingborg city council proposed that the new, enlarged municipality should be spelled ''Helsingborg''; this form was adopted by the [[government of Sweden]] from 1 January 1971.

In [[World War II]], Helsingborg was among the most important drop-off points for the rescue of Denmark's [[History of the Jews in Denmark|Jewish population]] during the [[Holocaust]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] had ordered that all Danish Jews were to be arrested and deported to the [[concentration camps]] on [[Rosh HaShanah]], the Jewish New Year which fell on 2 October 1943. When [[Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz]], a German maritime attaché received word of the order on 28 September 1943, he shared it with political and Jewish community leaders. Using the name [[Elsinore Sewing Club]] (Danish: Helsingør Syklub) as a cover for messages, the Danish population formed an [[Underground Railroad]] of sorts, moving Jews away from the closely watched [[Copenhagen]] docks to spots farther away, especially [[Helsingør]], just two miles across the Øresund from Helsingborg. Hundreds of civilians hid their fellow Danish citizens—Jews—in their houses, farm lofts and churches until they could board them onto Danish fishing boats, personal pleasure boats and ferry boats. In the span of three nights, Danes had smuggled over 7200 Jews and 680 non-Jews (gentile family members of Jews or political activists) across the Øresund, to safety in Sweden, with one of the main destinations at Helsingborg.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/rescue-of-the-danish-jews-evacuation-effects.html|title=Rescue of the Danish Jews: Evacuation & Effects|access-date=24 November 2018|first1=Katie|last1=Streit|website=study.com|url-access=subscription|archive-date=24 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124003651/https://study.com/academy/lesson/rescue-of-the-danish-jews-evacuation-effects.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Climate==
Helsingborg has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Cfb]]) typical of southern Sweden, although its winters are very mild for a location at such a high latitude. Although the temperature differences between seasons are significant, Helsingborg often lacks a [[meteorological winter]] with both January and February averaging just above the freezing point in terms of mean temperatures. Summers are warm and comparatively long by Swedish standards, with summer arriving earlier and fall later than virtually all areas of Sweden, aside from other parts of Skåne. Helsingborg & nearby surroundings also have a history with [[List of tornadoes striking downtown areas of large cities|being hit by tornadoes]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.eswd.eu/ |title=European Severe Weather Database |access-date=3 October 2023 |archive-date=18 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201218011836/https://eswd.eu/ |url-status=live }}</ref> On 8 August 1947, a High-end F1/T3 [[Tornado]] hit the Ramlösa district of Helsingborg, causing moderate damage to a farm.
