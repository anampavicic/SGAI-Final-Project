{{Nihongo|'''Iwaki'''|いわき市|Iwaki-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in [[Fukushima Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. {{As of|2023|08|01}}, Iwaki had a population of 322,019 in 143,500 households,<ref>[http://www.city.iwaki.lg.jp/www/index.html Iwaki City official statistics] {{in lang|ja}}</ref> and [[population density]] of 261 persons per km².

Iwaki is a designated [[Core cities of Japan|core city]], and is also one of the growing number of [[Hiragana and katakana place names|cities written in ''hiragana'']]. The present Iwaki City started as the merger of 14 smaller municipalities on October 1, 1966. Every year, Iwaki hosts the Taira Tanabata Festival from 6–8 August.<ref>http://www.goldenjipangu.com/130806iwaki.html</ref>

==Geography and climate==
The city is located at the southeastern end of [[Tōhoku region]] and borders on [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]. The city occupies around 8.9 percent of the total area of Fukushima Prefecture. The eastern part of the city is made up of {{convert|60|km}} of coastline which faces the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the western part goes through the [[Abukuma highlands]] and joins up with the central part of Fukushima Prefecture. The western part is a range of mountains and forests, which occupies about 70 percent of the city. The rivers which flow to the east from the mountains have riverbeds with steep inclines that form the deep valleys of the [[Natsuigawa Gorge]] and the [[Shidokigawa Gorge]]. The flatter eastern part of the city is where most of the population is located. There are seven beaches on the coastline. Off the coast of Iwaki, the warm [[Kuroshio Current]] and the cold [[Oyashio Current]] meet and make for an abundant fishing ground. The city's flag and seal depict the meeting of these two currents. The prevailing winds from the ocean are warm and wet.

==History==
[[File:Iwaki City Hall.jpg|thumb|Iwaki City Hall]]
The area of present-day Iwaki was part of ancient [[Mutsu Province]].  The forms いわき, 石城, 岩城, 巖城, 巌城, and 磐城 are all ways of writing "Iwaki", which means "rocky castle". Under the [[Nara period]] [[Taika Reform]] of 645 AD, the central government formed "Iwaki district (磐城郡)" in the northern part of the present city and "Kikuta district (菊多郡)" in the southern part.<ref name="Ofh">[http://www.city.iwaki.fukushima.jp/download/7d651a0c2c013c8/iwaki-history.pdf/ Iwaki's history] pdf  {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>  In 653, the Iwaki district incorporated part of [[Taga Province]] and became Iwaki district (岩城評).<ref name="Ofh" />  In 718, [[Iwaki Province (718)|Iwaki Province]] was formed, which was composed of five districts with [[Mutsu Province]]: Iwaki (岩城), Shineha, Namekata, Uta, Watari and Kikuta which was given from [[Hitachi Province]].  Shineha was the present [[Naraha, Fukushima|Naraha]]. Namekata and Uta were the present [[Sōma, Fukushima|Sōma]]. Watari was the present [[Watari, Miyagi]]. The area of the present Iwaki City was composed of Kikuta and Iwaki (岩城 or 磐城).<ref name="Ofh" /> The [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial government]] constructed the [[Nakoso barrier]]  around 708 AD against possible invasion by the [[Emishi]] tribes in the north.<ref name="Loh">[http://homepage2.nifty.com/kazuo-abe/a2-con-index.html/ Imamukashi kiko of Iwaki], Kofun period - Meiji Period{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref>

In the late 11th century, the [[Iwaki clan]] (岩城氏) of [[Hitachi Province]] invaded Iwaki district (磐城郡) and divided it into four districts of Yoshima, Iwasaki, Iwaki, Naraha. The clan ruled the area from the [[Kamakura period]] to the end of the [[Sengoku period]]. In 1600, Iwaki Sadataka opposed [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] during the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] and as a result, the Iwaki clan was deposed. [[Torii Tadamasa]] was appointed as ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Iwakitaira Domain]] under the [[Edo period]] [[Tokugawa shogunate]], with an assessed ''[[kokudaka]]'' of 100,000 ''[[koku]]'' and constructed [[Iwakitaira Castle]].<ref name="Ofh" /> The domain covered only a portion of what is now Iwaki city: other parts of the city were under the control of [[Izumi Domain]] (1634) and [[Yunagaya Domain]] (1670).  All three domains joined the [[Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei]] during the [[Bakumatsu period]] in support of the Tokugawa against the [[Satchō Alliance]] during the [[Boshin War]], but following the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the 1871 [[Abolition of the han system]] The new [[Meiji government]] created Iwakitaira Prefecture, Yunagaya Prefecture and Izumi Prefecture, which were incorporated to Iwamae (Iwasaki) Prefecture (磐前県) and to the current Fukushima Prefecture (1876).<ref name="Ofh" />  In 1896, Iwaki Bank and Taira Bank were established.

In 1897, the [[Japanese Government Railway]] filled in the inner moat of Iwakidaira Castle and built Taira Station. The [[Jōban coalfield]], the largest coalfield in [[Honshū]] and the nearest to the Japanese capital [[Tokyo]], was developed, and the population of Taira increased to support the exploitation of the coalfield. The [[Jōban Line]] was made for the haulage of the coal. Iwaki's fishery, forestry and agricultural sectors also developed from this time.<ref name="Loh" />  After [[World War II]], the Jōban coalfield was closed. The same natural hot springs that were troublesome to the coal miners were put to good use and a hot springs resort was developed [[Spa Resort Hawaiians]].

The present city was incorporated on October 1, 1966, with the merger of 14 municipalities (5 cities, 4 towns and 5 villages). The cities were '''Taira''' (平), '''Uchigō''' (内郷), '''Iwaki''' (磐城), '''Nakoso''' (勿来), and '''Jōban''' (常磐); the towns, '''Yotsukura''', (四倉) '''Tōno''' (遠野), '''Ogawa''' (小川) and '''Hisanohama''' (久之浜); and the five villages were '''Yoshima''' (好間), '''Miwa''' (三和), '''Tabito''' (田人), '''Kawamae''' (川前) and '''Ōhisa''' (大久).<ref name="Ofh" /> Taira was chosen as the location for the city hall and other administrative offices and continues to function as the centre of Iwaki. In April 1979, an "Iwaki Number" as an automobile [[Japanese license plates|number plate]] was introduced.

On April 1, 1999, the city was designated a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] with increased autonomy from the prefectural government.

On 11 March 2011, the city was struck by an [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and followed by a tsunami]]. By 20 May 2011, 303 were dead and 82 still missing.<ref>[http://mainichi.jp/select/jiken/graph/sinsai_zusetsu/ 東日本大震災　図説集] from mainichi.jp, [[Mainichi Shimbun]] 20 May 2011, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110622151952/http://mainichi.jp/select/jiken/graph/sinsai_zusetsu/ archived here]</ref>

==Government==
Iwaki has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 37 members. The city contributes 10 members to the Fukushima Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, Iwaki is part of the Fukushima 5th District (along with [[Futaba District, Fukushima|Futaba District]]) for a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

===Subdivisions===
Iwaki is a decentralised city created the merger of 14 municipalities  (5 cities, 4 towns and 5 villages).
