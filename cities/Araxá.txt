== Toponymy ==
The name "Araxá" was derived from the Araxás, an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|amerindian tribe]] that inhabited the region prior to the [[Colonial Brazil|European colonization of Brazil]], and means "the place where the sun is seen first," or, according to its [[Tupi language|Tupi]] origin, "elevated place" or "plateau".<ref name=":02">[http://www.araxa.mg.gov.br/Pagina.aspx?id=1 Prefeitura municipal de Araxá] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605143853/http://www.araxa.mg.gov.br/Pagina.aspx?id=1|date=June 5, 2013}}</ref>

Araxó, an extinct [[Jê languages#Varieties|Jê language]], was once spoken in the region.<ref name="Loukotka2">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=Čestmír |author-link=Čestmír Loukotka |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles |url-access=registration}}</ref>

== History ==
The earliest accounts of the region date back to the second half of the [[16th century]], when the first encounters with the indigenous people known as the "Araxás" occurred. The Araxás were a native group reportedly led by a warrior named Andaia-Aru, who had separated from their original tribe, known as the "Cataguases". They settled in the extensive region that includes the [[Canastra Mountains|Serra da Canastra]] and the [[Rio Grande (Paraná River tributary)|Rio Grande]], living in relative peace until the [[17th century|mid-17th century]], when European settlers arrived, lured by the area's lush forests and abundant mineral waters.

Interactions between the European settlers and the native population were characterized by frequent conflicts, culminating in the extermination of the Araxá people by the settlers following a [[Bandeiras|bandeira expedition]] led by Campo Inácio Correia de Pamplona (1731–1810), under the colonial administration of the time. Subsequently, much of the region came under the control of the [[Captaincies of Brazil|Captaincy of Minas Gerais]], which served as the local administrative division of colonial Brazil.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-09-04 |title=Araxá - dr. Pintassilgo - Migalhas |url=https://www.migalhas.com.br/drpintassilgo/134447/araxa/historico-da-cidade |access-date=2024-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240904073814/https://www.migalhas.com.br/drpintassilgo/134447/araxa/historico-da-cidade |archive-date=2024-09-04 }}</ref>

The first farm owners began to establish themselves in the region around 1770. As settlements grew, the area was designated as a [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]] in 1791, taking the name "São Domingos de Araxá", in honor of [[Saint Dominic]], the founder of the [[Order of Preachers]].

In 1831, São Domingos de Araxá was elevated to the status of a "vila" ([[town]]), and it was granted [[city status]] on December 19, 1865, due to its local development. The name "Araxá" was officially adopted three years later, in 1868, and has remained in use to this day.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Araxá { History } |url=https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/brasil/mg/araxa/historico |access-date=2024-09-04 |website=cidades.ibge.gov.br}}</ref>

==Economic activities==
[[Image:Grande Hotel Araxá.jpg|thumb|300px|The Grande Hotel Termas de Araxá, located in the Barreiro Complex.]]
The economy is based on tourism, services, mining, industry, and some agriculture.

Araxá is famous in Brazil for its spa with medicinal mud and mineral waters.  One of Brazil's most emblematic hotels, the Grande Hotel, is the center of attraction.  Opened in 1944 by governor Benedito Valadares and President Vargas, the Hotel initiated an era of splendor to Araxá and the inland region of the state. It was the stage for huge social, political and cultural events.  Overall, the city's hotel sector has 24 establishments offering 2,708 beds (2004).
One of Brazil's most famous soap operas, ''[[Dona Beja|Dona Beija]]'', loosely based on the life of a legendary historic character of the city, was filmed here.

In addition to tourism, the city has a [[niobium]] mine. That metal is used in special steels and alloys for jet engine components, rocket sub-assemblies, and heat-resisting and combustion equipment.  Reserves are about 460 million tons, sufficient to satisfy current world demand for about 500 years. The largest enterprise in this sector is CBMM—[[Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração]].<ref name="araxa.mg.gov.br"/>

Araxá is also a major producer of [[Phosphorite|phosphate]] concentrate, essential for the production of [[fertilizer]]s. The most important company in this sector is [[Vale Fertilizantes|Vale Fertilizantes S.A.]], which was acquired by [[The Mosaic Company]] in 2018, and operates the largest single [[Monocalcium phosphate|superphosphate]] production plant in Brazil.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mosaic completed acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes {{!}} Highlight {{!}} Chambers and Partners |url=https://chambers.com/articles/mosaic-completed-acquisition-of-vale-fertilizantes |access-date=2024-10-08 |website=chambers.com |language=en}}</ref>

In 2005, Araxá recorded a [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of 1.439 billion [[Brazilian real|Brazilian reais]], generated almost equally by the services and industry sectors. During the same period, the workforce included 2,865 employees in industry, 1,478 in construction, 7,636 in commerce, 1,296 in restaurants and hotels, and 2,691 in public administration. The municipality contained 405 rural properties covering a total of 68,000 hectares (170,000 acres). Approximately 1,500 individuals were employed in agriculture. The livestock population comprised 65,000 head of cattle, primarily used for dairy production, with an estimated daily output of 500,000 litres (130,000 US gallons) in 2004. In addition, there was significant production of poultry and swine, and 22 producers of [[cachaça]] were registered in 2004. The main agricultural crops included coffee, corn, and soybeans.<ref name="ibge.gov.br">[http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/default.php IBGE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611095922/http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/default.php|date=June 11, 2008}}</ref> As of 2021, Araxá reported a GDP of 8.951 billion Brazilian reais, ranking 163rd in Brazil and a GDP per capita of R$ 82.570,25.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Produto Interno Bruto dos Municípios {{!}} IBGE |url=https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/economicas/contas-nacionais/9088-produto-interno-bruto-dos-municipios.html?t=pib-por-municipio&c=3104007 |access-date=2024-10-08 |website=www.ibge.gov.br}}</ref> 

==Health and education==
In the health sector there were 17 health clinics and 4 hospitals with 244 beds (2005). There were also 6 clinical analysis laboratories and 34 pharmacies. Two of the hospitals were private, and two were philanthropic. The educational needs of 10,500 students were met by 33 primary schools, 11 middle schools, and 40 pre-primary schools. In higher education, there were two institutions: Centro Universitário Planalto de Araxá, and, Universidade do Triângulo Mineiro (UNIT).<ref>[http://www.araxa.mg.gov.br/ Prefeitura municipal de Araxá]</ref>

In 2004, the healthcare statistics indicated a ratio of one doctor for every 598 inhabitants and an availability of 3.5 hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants. The infant mortality rate stood at 8.70 deaths per 1,000 live births in the same year, significantly lower than both the state and national averages. For comparison, the infant mortality rate was recorded at 20.80 deaths per 1,000 live births in the year 2000.<ref name="araxa.mg.gov.br"/>
