'''Jammu''' ({{IPAc-en|'|dʒ|ʌ|m|uː}}) is a city in [[India]]n-administered  [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]] in the disputed [[Kashmir]] region.<ref name=tertiary-kashmir>The application of the term "administered" to the various regions of [[Kashmir]] and a mention of the Kashmir dispute is supported by the [[WP:TERTIARY|tertiary sources]] (a) through (d), reflecting [[WP:DUE|due weight]] in the coverage. Although "controlled" and "held" are also applied neutrally  to the names of the disputants or to the regions administered by them, as evidenced in sources (f) through (h) below, "held" is also considered politicised usage, as is the term "occupied," (see (i) below). <br/>

</ref> It is the [[winter capital]] of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an Indian-administered [[union territory]].  It is the headquarters and the largest city in [[Jammu district]]. Lying on the banks of the river [[Tawi River|Tawi]], the city of Jammu, with an area of {{cvt|240|sqkm}},<ref name='JMC'/> is surrounded by the [[Himalayas]] in the north and the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|northern plains]] in the south. Jammu is the second-most populous city of the union territory. Jammu is known as "City of Temples" for its ancient temples and Hindu shrines.

It is approximately {{convert|600|km|mi}} from the national capital, [[New Delhi]].

The city straddles the Tawi river.  The old city overlooks the river from the north (right bank) while the new neighbourhoods are spread around the southern side (left bank) of the river. There are five bridges over the river.

==History==
According to ''[[Tarikh-i-Azmi]]'', Jammu came into existence around 900 CE. The state of ''Durgara'' (modern forms "Duggar" and "[[Dogras|Dogra]])") is also attested from around this time.{{sfn|Kapur, History of Jammu and Kashmir State|1980|pp=9–10}}{{sfn|Charak & Billwaria, Pahāṛi Styles of Indian Murals|1998|p=6}} The capital of the Durgara state at that time is believed to have been Vallapura (identified with modern [[Billawar]]). Its rulers are repeatedly mentioned in Kalhana's ''[[Rajatarangini]]''.{{sfn|Bamzai, Culture and Political History of Kashmir|1994|p=184}} Babbapura (modern Babor) is another state mentioned in ''Rajatarangini'', some of whose rulers also appear by in the ''Vamshavali'' (family chronicles) of later Jammu rulers. These rulers are believed to have enjoyed almost independent status and allied themselves with the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultans of Delhi]].

Jammu is mentioned by name in the chronicles of [[Timur]] ({{reign|1370|1406}}), who invaded Delhi in 1398 and returned to [[Samarkand]] via Jammu. Raja Bhim Dev is prominently mentioned in the Delhi chronicles as a supporter of [[Mubarak Shah (Sayyid dynasty)|Mubarah Shah]] ({{reign|1421|1434}}) against [[Jasrat]].{{sfn|Charak & Billwaria, Pahāṛi Styles of Indian Murals|1998|pp=6–7}} Between 1423 and 1442, Jammu came under control of Jasrat ({{reign|1405|1442}}) who [[Jasrat#Invasion of Jammu (1423)|conquered it]] after killing his arch-enemy Bhim Dev in 1423. Later, Jasrat appointed Manik Dev (also known as Ajeo Dev) as vassal, and married his daughter.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Charak |first=Sukh Dev Singh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KhtIAAAAIAAJ&q=A+Short+History+of+Jammu+Raj |title=A Short History of Jammu Raj: From Earliest Times to 1846 A.D. |date=1985 |publisher=Ajaya Prakashan |language=en|pages=76–78}}</ref> In the Mughal chronicles of [[Babur]] in the early 16th century, Jammu is mentioned as a powerful state in the Punjab hills. It is said to have been ruled by [[Manhas]] Rajputs. Emperor [[Akbar]] brought the hill kingdoms of the region under Mughal suzerainty, but the kings enjoyed considerable political autonomy. In addition to Jammu, other kingdoms of the region such as [[Kishtwar]] and [[Rajauri]] were also prominently mentioned. It is evident that the Mughal empire treated these hill chiefs as allies and partners in the empire.{{sfn|Jigar Mohammad, Raja Ranjit Dev's Inclusive Policies|2010|pp=40–42}}

=== Modern history===
[[File:Maharaja Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir.jpg|thumb|right|Maharaja [[Gulab Singh]] of Jammu and Kashmir]]
[[File:Maharaja of Kashmir, Hari Singh (1895 - 1961).jpg|thumb|right|Maharaja of Kashmir, [[Hari Singh]] (1895 - 1961)]]

After the decline of the Mughal power in the 18th century, the Jammu state under Raja Dhruv Dev of the ''Jamuwal'' (''[[Jamwal]]'') family asserted its supremacy among the Dugar states. Its ascent reached its peak under his successor, Raja Ranjit Dev (r.&nbsp;1728–1780), who was widely respected among the hill states.{{sfn|Jeratha, Dogra Legends of Art & Culture|1998|p=187}}{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|p=10}} Ranjit Dev promoted religious freedom and security, which attracted many craftsmen and traders to settle in Jammu, contributing to its economic prosperity.{{sfn|Rai, Hindu Rulers, Muslim Subjects|2004|pp=94–95}}

Towards the end of Ranjit Dev's rule, the Sikh clans of Punjab (''[[misls]]'') gained ascendency, and Jammu began to be contested by the [[Bhangi Misl|Bhangi]], [[Kanhaiya Misl|Kanhaiya]] and [[Sukerchakia Misl|Sukerchakia]] ''misls''. Around 1770, the Bhangi ''misl'' attacked Jammu and forced Ranjit Dev to become a tributary. Brij Lal Dev, Ranjit Dev's successor, was defeated by the Sukerchakia chief Mahan Singh, who sacked Jammu and plundered it. Thus Jammu lost its supremacy over the surrounding country. In the Battle of Rumal, the Jammu ruler was killed by Sikhs.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12482/page/n41/mode/2up|title=Indian Conquest of the Himalayan Territories|author=Sukhdev Singh Charak|date=1978|pages=37|publisher=Ajaya Prakashan, Jammu }}</ref>{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|p=10–12}}

In 1808, Jammu itself was annexed to the [[Sikh Empire]] by [[Ranjit Singh]], the son of Mahan Singh.{{sfn|Panikkar, Gulab Singh|1930|p=15–16}}

In 1818 Raja Kishore Singh, father of Raja [[Gulab Singh]], was appointed and anointed the ruler of Jammu principality, and hence started the Jamwal dynasty, aka [[Dogra dynasty]], which came to rule the princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] under British suzerainty. The rulers built large temples, renovated old shrines, built educational institutes and many more. A 43&nbsp;km long [[Jammu–Sialkot line|railway line]] connecting Jammu with [[Sialkot]] was laid in 1897<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V14_055.gif|title=Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 14, page 49 -- Imperial Gazetteer of India -- Digital South Asia Library|website=dsal.uchicago.edu}}</ref>

Jammu has historically been the capital of [[Jammu Division|Jammu Province]] and the winter capital of the princely state of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] (1846&ndash;1952).

After the partition of India, Jammu continues as the winter capital of the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]].

==Climate==

Jammu, like the rest of north-western India, features a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa''), with extreme summer highs reaching {{convert|46|C|F}}, and temperatures in the winter months occasionally falling below {{convert|4|C|F}}. June is the hottest month with average highs of {{convert|40.6|C|F}}, while January is the coldest month with average lows reaching {{convert|7|C|F}}. Average yearly precipitation is about {{convert|1400|mm|in|abbr=on}} with the bulk of the rainfall in the months from June to September, although the winters can also be rather wet. In winter dense smog causes much inconvenience and temperature even drops to {{convert|2|C|F}}. In summer, particularly in May and June, extremely intense sunlight or hot winds can raise the temperature to {{convert|46|C|F}}. Following the hot season, the [[monsoon]] lashes the city with heavy downpours along with thunderstorms; rainfall may total up to {{cvt|669|mm|in}} in the wettest months. The city is exposed to heatwaves.{{clarify|date=April 2020}}

[[File:NE Aerial Jammu Tawi Rly Station Jul24 A7CR 01922.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of [[Jammu Tawi]] station]]
Jammu city has a railway station called [[Jammu Tawi]] (station code JAT) that is connected with major cities of India. The old [[Jammu–Sialkot line|railway link]] to Sialkot was suspended by Pakistan in September 1947, and Jammu had no rail services until 1971, when the [[Indian Railways]] laid the [[Pathankot]]-Jammu Tawi [[Broad Gauge]] line. The new Jammu Tawi station opened in October 1972 and is an origination point for express trains.
With the commencement of the [[Jammu–Baramulla line]], all trains to the [[Kashmir Valley]] will pass through Jammu Tawi. A part of the Jammu–Baramulla project has been executed and the track has been extended to [[Katra, Jammu and Kashmir|Katra]]. [[Jalandhar]] - [[Pathankot]]-Jammu Tawi section has been doubled and electrified.

[[NH 44|National Highway 44]]  which passes through Jammu connects it to the [[Kashmir valley]]. National Highway 1B connects Jammu with Poonch town. Jammu is {{convert|80|km|mi}} from Kathua town, while it is {{convert|68|km|mi}} from Udhampur city. The famous pilgrimage town of [[Katra, Jammu and Kashmir|Katra]] is {{convert|49|km|mi}} from Jammu.

[[Jammu Airport]] is in the middle of Jammu. It has direct flights to [[Srinagar]], [[Delhi]], [[Amritsar]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Leh]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Bengaluru]]. Jammu Airport operates daily 30 arrival and departure of flights which are served by [[Go First]], [[Air India]], [[SpiceJet]], [[IndiGo]] and [[Vistara]].

The city has [[JKSRTC]] city buses and minibusses for local transport which run on some defined routes. These minibusses are called "Matadors". Besides this auto-rickshaw and cycle-rickshaw service is also available. Local taxis are also available.
