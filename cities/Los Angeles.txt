The historic center of Tongva power in the region was the settlement of [[Yaanga]] ([[Tongva language|Tongva]]: ''Iyáangẚ''), meaning "place of the [[Toxicodendron diversilobum|poison oak]]", which would one day be the site where the Spanish founded the [[Pueblo de Los Ángeles]].

Los Angeles created the first municipal [[zoning]] ordinance in the United States. On September 14, 1908, the [[Los Angeles City Council, 1889–1909|Los Angeles City Council]] promulgated residential and industrial land use zones. The new ordinance established three residential zones of a single type, where industrial uses were prohibited. The proscriptions included barns, lumber yards, and any industrial land use employing machine-powered equipment. These laws were enforced against industrial properties after the fact. These prohibitions were in addition to existing activities that were already regulated as nuisances. These included explosives warehousing, gas works, oil drilling, slaughterhouses, and [[Tannery|tanneries]]. Los Angeles City Council also designated seven industrial zones within the city. However, between 1908 and 1915, the Los Angeles City Council created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions that applied to these three residential zones, and as a consequence, some industrial uses emerged within them. There are two differences between the 1908 Residence District Ordinance and later zoning laws in the United States. First, the 1908 laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning map as the [[Zoning in the United States#Origins and history|1916 New York City Zoning Ordinance]] did. Second, the residential zones did not distinguish types of housing; they treated apartments, hotels, and detached-single-family housing equally.<ref name="weiss80">{{cite book|title=The Rise of the Community Builders: The American Real Estate Industry and Urban Land Planning|author=Weiss, Marc A|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0-231-06505-4|location=New York|pages=80{{endash}}86}}</ref>

[[File:WSA Photo 4235.jpg|thumb|right|During [[World War II]], the [[California Shipbuilding Corporation]] on [[Terminal Island]] was among the many builders that made the [[Port of Los Angeles]] one of the largest [[shipyards]] in the country.]]
During [[United States home front during World War II|World War II]] Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. [[California Shipbuilding Corporation|Calship]] built hundreds of [[Liberty Ship]]s and [[Victory Ship]]s on Terminal Island, and the Los Angeles area was the headquarters of six of the country's major aircraft manufacturers ([[Douglas Aircraft Company]], [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes Aircraft]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[North American Aviation]], [[Northrop Corporation]], and [[Vultee Aircraft|Vultee]]). During the war, more aircraft were produced in one year than in all the pre-war years since the Wright brothers flew the first airplane in 1903, combined. Manufacturing in Los Angeles skyrocketed, and as [[William S. Knudsen]], of the National Defense Advisory Commission put it, "We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible."<ref>Parker, Dana T.

In the second half of the 20th century, Los Angeles substantially reduced the amount of housing that could be built by drastically [[Zoning in the United States|downzoning]] the city.

===Topography===
[[File:Los Angeles by Sentinel-2, 2019-03-30.jpg|thumb|Satellite view of Los Angeles]]
The city of Los Angeles covers a total area of {{convert|502.7|sqmi|km2|0|sp=us}}, comprising {{convert|468.7|sqmi|km2}} of land and {{convert|34.0|sqmi|km2}} of water.<ref name="gazetteer">{{Cite US Gazetteer|2010|places|CA}}</ref> The city extends for {{convert|44|mi|km}} from north to south and for {{convert|29|mi|km}} from east to west. The perimeter of the city is {{convert|342|mi|km}}.

Los Angeles is both flat and hilly. The highest point in the city proper is [[Mount Lukens]] at {{convert|5074|ft|m|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#50|title=Elevations of the 50 Largest Cities (by population, 1980 Census)|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002023211/http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html|archive-date=October 2, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=October 3, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://angeles.sierraclub.org/hps/guides/09e.htm|title=Mount Lukens Guide|publisher=[[Sierra Club]] Angeles Chapter|access-date=October 3, 2011|archive-date=November 24, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124012746/http://angeles.sierraclub.org/hps/guides/09e.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> located in the foothills of the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] at the north extent of the [[Crescenta Valley]]. The eastern end of the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] stretches from [[Downtown Los Angeles|Downtown]] to the Pacific Ocean and separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley. Other hilly parts of Los Angeles include the [[Mt. Washington, Los Angeles|Mt. Washington]] area north of Downtown, eastern parts such as [[Boyle Heights]], the [[Crenshaw, Los Angeles|Crenshaw district]] around the [[Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles|Baldwin Hills]], and the [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]] district.

Surrounding the city are much higher mountains. Immediately to the north lie the [[San Gabriel Mountains]], which is a popular recreation area for Angelenos. Its high point is [[Mount San Antonio]], locally known as Mount Baldy, which reaches {{convert|10064|ft|m}}. Further afield, the highest point in southern California is [[San Gorgonio Mountain]], {{convert|81|mi|km}} east of downtown Los Angeles,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/@34.1149676,-116.8483927,10.69z|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|access-date=May 31, 2022|archive-date=May 31, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220531234432/https://www.google.com/maps/@34.1149676,-116.8483927,10.69z|url-status=live}}</ref> with a height of {{convert|11503|ft}}.

The [[Los Angeles River]], which is largely seasonal, is the primary [[drainage channel]]. It was straightened and lined in {{convert|51|mi|km}} of concrete by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] to act as a flood control channel.<ref name="Gumprecht2001">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ftBJpp7aIoC|title=The Los Angeles River: Its Life, Death, and Possible Rebirth|last=Gumprecht|first=Blake|date=March 2001|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6642-5|page=173|access-date=October 3, 2011|archive-date=November 6, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231106164859/https://books.google.com/books?id=2ftBJpp7aIoC|url-status=live}}</ref> The river begins in the [[Canoga Park, Los Angeles|Canoga Park]] district of the city, flows east from the San Fernando Valley along the north edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, and turns south through the city center, flowing to its mouth in the Port of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] at the Pacific Ocean.

===Vegetation===

[[File:The Duck Pond at Playa del Rey.jpg|thumb|left|[[Del Rey Lagoon Park|Del Rey Lagoon]] in [[Playa del Rey]]]]
Los Angeles is rich in native plant species partly because of its diversity of habitats, including beaches, [[wetland]]s, and mountains. The most prevalent plant communities are [[coastal sage scrub]], [[chaparral]] shrubland, and [[riparian woodland]].<ref name="Miller2008">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RjbPQ6ZOgzMC&pg=PA15|title=Landscaping with Native Plants of Southern California|last=Miller|first=George Oxford|date=January 15, 2008|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-2967-2|page=15|access-date=October 6, 2011|archive-date=November 6, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231106164900/https://books.google.com/books?id=RjbPQ6ZOgzMC&pg=PA15|url-status=live}}</ref> Native plants include: the [[California poppy]], [[matilija poppy]], [[Heteromeles|toyon]], [[Ceanothus]], [[Chamise]], [[Coast Live Oak]], [[Platanus racemosa|sycamore]], [[willow]] and [[Leymus condensatus|Giant Wildrye]]. Many of these native species, such as the [[Helianthus nuttallii|Los Angeles sunflower]], have become so rare as to be considered endangered. [[Washingtonia robusta|Mexican Fan Palms]], [[Phoenix canariensis|Canary Island Palms]], [[Syagrus romanzoffiana|Queen Palms]], [[Date Palm]]s, and [[Washingtonia filifera|California Fan Palms]] are common in the Los Angeles area, although only the last is native to California, though still not native to the City of Los Angeles.

===Geology===
[[File:Mt. Lukens overlooking La Crescenta-Montrose.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Lukens]], in the [[San Gabriel Mountains]], is the highest point in LA.]]
Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes because of its location on the [[Ring of Fire|Pacific Ring of Fire]].

====Overview====
[[File:The Griffith Observatory at night, Mt. Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Downtown Los Angeles]] skyline from [[Griffith Park]]]]
The city's street patterns generally follow a [[grid plan]], with uniform block lengths and occasional roads that cut across blocks. However, this is complicated by rugged terrain, which has necessitated having different grids for each of the valleys that Los Angeles covers. Major streets are designed to move large volumes of traffic through many parts of the city, many of which are extremely long; [[Sepulveda Boulevard]] is {{convert|43|mi}} long, while [[Foothill Boulevard (Southern California)|Foothill Boulevard]] is over {{convert|60|mi}} long, reaching as far east as San Bernardino. Drivers in Los Angeles suffer from one of the worst rush hour periods in the world, according to an annual traffic index by navigation system maker, [[TomTom]]. LA drivers spend an additional 92 hours in traffic each year. During the peak rush hour, there is 80% congestion, according to the index.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/04/01/worst-cities-traffic-usa-los-angeles/70762026/ |date=April 1, 2015 |first1=Mary |last1=Bowerman |title=Los Angeles tops worst cities for traffic in USA|website=USA TODAY|access-date=December 31, 2015|archive-date=January 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101060623/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/04/01/worst-cities-traffic-usa-los-angeles/70762026/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Los Angeles is often characterized by the presence of [[low-rise]] buildings, in contrast to New York City. Outside of a few centers such as [[Downtown Los Angeles|Downtown]], [[Warner Center]], [[Century City]], [[Koreatown, Los Angeles|Koreatown]], [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles|Miracle Mile]], Hollywood, and [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]], skyscrapers and high-rise buildings are not common in Los Angeles. The few skyscrapers built outside of those areas often stand out above the rest of the surrounding landscape. Most construction is done in separate units, rather than [[Curtain wall (architecture)|wall-to-wall]]. However, Downtown Los Angeles itself has many buildings over 30 stories, with fourteen over 50 stories, and two over 70 stories, the tallest of which is the [[Wilshire Grand Center]].

The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more. Years of average rainfall are rare.

Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog. The [[Los Angeles Basin]] and the [[San Fernando Valley]] are susceptible to [[Inversion (meteorology)|atmospheric inversion]], which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65|title=What can we do about smog?|last=Stimson|first=Thomas E.|date=July 1955|journal=[[Popular Mechanics]]|page=65|issn=0032-4558|access-date=October 6, 2011|archive-date=November 6, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231106164903/https://books.google.com/books?id=xdwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref>

Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the [[United States Clean Air Act|Clean Air Act]]. When the act was passed, California was unable to create a [[State Implementation Plan]] that would enable it to meet the new air quality standards, largely because of the level of pollution in Los Angeles generated by older vehicles.<ref>"Early Implementation of the Clean Air Act of 1970 in California."

July 12, 2016.</ref> More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating [[low-emission vehicle]]s. Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years because of aggressive steps to reduce it, which include [[Electric car|electric]] and [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] cars, improvements in [[mass transit]], and other measures.

The charter of the City of Los Angeles ratified by voters in 1999 created a system of advisory neighborhood councils that would represent the diversity of stakeholders, defined as those who live, work or own property in the neighborhood. The neighborhood councils are relatively autonomous and spontaneous in that they identify their own boundaries, establish their own bylaws, and elect their own officers. There are about 90 neighborhood councils.

Residents of Los Angeles elect [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors|supervisors]] for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th supervisorial districts.

There are numerous additional colleges and universities outside the city limits in the Greater Los Angeles area, including the [[Claremont Colleges]] consortium, which includes the most selective liberal arts colleges in the U.S., and the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), one of the top STEM-focused research institutions in the world.
