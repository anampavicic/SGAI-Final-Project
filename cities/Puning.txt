Historically, Puning was one of the eight counties of [[Chaoshan]]. In the mid-1900s, the [[Hakka people|Hakka region]], which was historically part of the [[Huizhou|Huizhou Prefecture]], was incorporated into Puning's territory. Subsequently, the city also welcomed back 'returned overseas Chinese' and 'family members of overseas Chinese' due to the political situation in Southeast Asia. The cultures of the various clans formed the multilingual, multicultural landscape of Puning, where customs and traditions differ across the towns and villages. It is recognised as a Chinese Folk Culture Art Village by the Ministry of Culture, China.

==Etymology==
'Puning' is the [[pinyin]] transliteration of the city in [[Standard Chinese]], also known as Mandarin or ''putonghua''. It is also known as ''''Pou Leng'''', '''Poh Leng,''' or '''Pho Leng''' in the Chaoshan language, also known as [[Chaoshan Min]] or [[Swatow dialect]] . It was named after the historical county of the same name, which dates back to the [[Ming dynasty]] of China. According to ''Puning Xian Zhilue (A Brief Account of Puning County)'', ''Guangdong Tongzhi (Comprehensive Records of Guangdong)'', ''Ming Shi ([[History of Ming]]),''<ref  group="ref">《明史》卷四十五</ref> and ''Chao Zhong Zaji (Miscellaneous Accounts of Chaozhou)'',<ref name=orig  group="ref">[明] 郭子章:《潮中杂纪》卷1《郡县释名》</ref> the name 'Puning' was given in 1563, after the phrase ''pubian ningmi'', meaning universally serene. Versions mentioned the county's original name as Pu'an<ref name=puan  group="ref">[清] 乾隆《大清一统志》广东卷</ref> or Anpu,<ref name=anpu  group="ref">[清] 顾祖禹:《读史方舆纪要》卷103《广东四·潮州府》</ref> but this was refuted by an inscription on the external walls of a [[Lords of the Three Mountains]] temple in [[Guiyu, Guangdong|Guiyu, Chaoyang]], discovered in 1986.<ref  group="ref">陈竞飞：《去思碑与普宁县名》，1988年</ref>

In 1949, the seat of Puning County was administered as Puning City. The City's territory was split in 1950. In 1993, Puning County upgraded to become Puning City, while the original 'Puning City' became its city centre.

==History==

===Before its founding===
[[File:Scene Restore of Hutoupu Kilns.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|Reproduction scene of early humans making pottery at Hutou Pu Old Kilns Site}}]]
The habitation of humans in the territory of Puning dates back to the [[Neolithic|New Stone Age]], evident in archaeological findings, such as the [[Hutou Pu Old Kilns Site]] (虎头埔古窑址) in Mianyuan Village, Guangtai Town, discovered in 1982. The tomb of a Sinicised [[Baiyue]] person, discovered in Songbaiwei Village, Lihu Town, illustrates that by the end of the [[Han dynasty|Eastern Han]] period, [[Zhongyuan culture|Central Plains (Zhongyuan) culture]] had been introduced into Puning.<ref group="ref"> 黄挺：《潮汕史简编》暨南大学出版社 2017年12月</ref>

During the [[Pre-Qin]] era, the succeeding political regimes on Zhongyuan did not have any ''de facto'' administration of Puning and its surrounding regions. It was incorporated into Zhongyuan territories during the Qin and Han dynasties, but there had never been any clear administrative borders in the regions.

===Ming and Qing===
{{expand section|date=February 2023}}

In 1558, [[Zhang Lian (died 1562)|Zhang Lian]] started a rebellion in [[Raoping County|Raoping]] and [[Dabu County|Dabu]] of eastern Chaozhou (Teochew) Prefecture and subsequently declared himself Emperor of the Feilong Empire. It was suppressed by the Ming Government in 1562.

=== Republic of China ===
In the 1860s many Southern Chinese were caught up in the various Internal conflicts and later in the Foreign conflicts. Later many Families ended up in Hawaii, the Philippines, Hong Kong and even in Thailand and Cambodia. Some of the educated classes married into Japanese Society. Other fled seeking Gold in USA and Australia and others became Traders across Asia.

====Beijing Government====
[[File:Peifeng Tower.jpg|thumb|left|{{center|During the Constitutional Protection War, the southern forces had an advantage over the northern forces as they occupied the Peifeng Tower}}]]

=====Xinhai Revolution and Constitutional Protection War=====
In October 1911, the [[National Revolution Army]] (NRA) started a [[Wuchang Uprising|rebellion in Wuchang]], while Fang Cishi (1887-1915) of the ''[[Tongmenghui]]'' dispatched troops in Puning. Guangdong declared its independence from the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] the following month and abolished the Chaozhou Prefecture, rendering counties such as Puning under the control of the Governor of Guangdong. Liu Renchen from the ''Tongmenghui'' also led his troops into Puning's city area. As a result, there were 13 different rival commanding officers in the [[Chaoshan]] region, all from different factions of the NRA. Meanwhile, influential figures in the county Puning supported Fang Zhiting as the county chief,<ref name=minguo group="ref">十兄、一士：《民国普宁县署轶事》，1990年</ref> while Zhao Diyun was, on the other hand, appointed Chief of Civil Affairs by Fang Cishi under the name of the Chaoshan Military Government. However, Zhao's appointment was short-lived as he was hindered by local officials and influential figures.<ref name=minguo group="ref">十兄、一士：《民国普宁县署轶事》，1990年</ref> In April 1912, the Deputy Governor of Guangdong, [[Chen Jiongming]], sent his trusted aide, Chen Juemin, as the Civil Affairs Chief. The administrative division of Chaodun [[Circuit (administrative division)|Circuit]] was established in 1914 and Puning was drawn into it; the Circuit was abolished in 1920.

In 1917, [[Duan Qirui]] led his troops to attack southern China after he abolished the ''[[Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China]]'', while [[Sun Yat-sen]] established the [[Constitutional Protection Junta]] in Guangzhou, sparking the [[Constitutional Protection Movement]]. Both armies fought outside the city walls of Puning, in the villages of Wuli and Minggang.<ref name=88xz group="ref">1988年版《普宁县志》，普宁市地方志编纂委员会编，广东人民出版社，1995年7月</ref> On 25 May 1921, Puning was brought under the control of Chen Jiongming's forces once again.

=====National Revolution=====
[[File:Fang's_Commission_by_Zhou.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|1=Letter of Appointment handwritten by Zhou Enlai during the National Revolution Army's second Eastern Expedition}}]]
On 12 March 1925, [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[He Yingqin]], and [[Zhou Enlai]] led the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) to defeat Chen's forces in Lihu of eastern Puning. On 2 November 1925, the NRA arrived in the city area of Puning, and Zhou made speeches there to raise funds for the army. On the same year, the [[Government of the Republic of China in Guangzhou]] announced that the Chaozhou (Teochew) and Meizhou regions came under the rule of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party]] (''Kuomintang''; KMT). Fang Zhiting was appointed the chief of Puning while Fang Zhanying became the acting Prosecutor.

The Puning Farmers' Association established the Farmers' Free City under the Peifeng Tower located in the suburb in February 1926, and founded the Farmers' Self-Defence Army in December of the same year, attacking the city twice.

The [[Shanghai massacre]] in April 1927 had a repercussion on the county of Puning. The [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP)'s Puning branch joined forces with left-wing KMT members to stage an armed riot on 23 April, and subsequently set up the first county-level revolutionary regime led by the CCP through armed conflict three days later at the Chen (Tan) clan ancestral shrine in Jiujiang, Daba. The CCP declared war against Chiang Kai-shek in a public address to the Chinese nation.<ref name=dang group="ref">《中共普宁党史》中共党史出版社，1994年</ref> However, the Farmers' Free City regime and the CCP's Provisional People's Government regime ceased their activities as they lost their battle to the KMT.

====Nanjing Government====

=====Civil war and infrastructure development=====
In October 1927, the [[Nanchang Uprising]] forces retreated to Liusha and conducted a military conference in Liusha Christian Church on 3 October. The uprising forces were attacked and defeated by [[Chen Jitang]]'s forces.

In 1928, [[Peng Pai]] led the [[Chinese Red Army|Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army]] into Puning and met up with remnant forces of the Nanchang Uprising, to discuss setting up a revolutionary base in the [[Nanshan Mountains|Dananshan Mountain]] area.
