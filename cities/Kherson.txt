==Etymology==
As the first new settlement in the [[Greek Plan|"Greek project"]] of [[Catherine the Great|Empress Catherine]] and her [[favourite]] [[Grigory Potemkin]], it was named after the [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea Pontic]] colony of [[Chersonesus]] ({{lang-grc-gre|Χερσόνησος|Khersónēsos}} {{IPA-el|kʰer.só.nɛː.sos|}}{{efn|From two [[Greek language|Greek]] words: khersos ({{lang|grc|χέρσος}}, "dry") and nesos ({{lang|grc|νῆσος}}, "land")}}) which was located on the [[Crimea|Crimean Peninsula]], meaning 'peninsular shore'.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Yanko |first=M.

=== Early days and Russian Empire era (until 1917) ===

[[File:F.St. Alexandre.jpg|thumb|1769 map showing Fort St. Alexandre]]}}
Before 1774, the area where Kherson is situated today belonged to the [[Crimean Khanate]]. A German-language map in 1736 (inset) shows a settlement of Bilschowscei at the site of today's Kherson. A French-language map of the site in 1769 (inset) shows a Russian-built fort or [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]] named St. Alexandre. This had been built in 1737 during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739)|Russo-Turkish War]] and served the [[Zaporizhian Sich]] as an administrative center, run by local [[Cossacks]].

The [[Russian Empire]] annexed the territory in 1774, and a decree of [[Catherine the Great]] on 18 June 1778 founded Kherson on the high bank of the Dnieper as a central fortress of the [[Black Sea Fleet]].

1783 saw the city granted the rights of a district town and the opening of a local shipyard where the hulls of the Russian Black Sea fleet were laid. Within a year the Kherson Shipping Company began operations. By the end of the 18th century, the port had established trade with France, Italy, Spain and other European countries. Between 1783 and 1793 Poland's maritime trade via the Black Sea was conducted through Kherson by the ''[[Kompania Handlowa Polska]]''. In 1791, Potemkin was buried in the newly built St. Catherine's Cathedral. In 1803 the city became the capital of the [[Kherson Governorate]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{lang|ru|"Херсон"}} [Kherson]. In Vvedensky, B. A., ed. (1957).

=== Soviet era (1917–1991) ===
==== Early Bolshevik period ====
In the [[1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election|Russian Constituent Assembly election]] held in November 1917—the first and last free election in Kherson for 70 years—Bolsheviks who had seized power in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and [[Moscow]] received just 13.2 percent of the vote in the [[Kherson Governorate|Governorate]]. The largest electoral bloc in the district, with 43 percent of the vote, was an alliance of [[Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionaries]] (SRs), Russian [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]] and the [[United Jewish Socialist Workers Party]].<ref name="Radkey1989-161-163">{{cite book |author=Oliver Henry Radkey |url=https://archive.org/details/russiagoestopoll00radk |title=Russia goes to the polls: the election to the all-Russian Constituent Assembly, 1917 |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-8014-2360-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/russiagoestopoll00radk/page/161 161]–163 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

But, before the Bolsheviks could secure Kherson, they were obliged to cede the region under the terms of the March 1918 [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] to the German and Austrian controlled [[Ukrainian State]]. After the withdrawal of German and Austrian forces in November 1918, the efforts of the UPR (the [[Petliurites|Petluirites]]) to assert authority were frustrated by a [[Southern Russia intervention|French-led Allied intervention]] which occupied Kherson in January 1919.<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Akulov |first=Mikhail |date=18 October 2013 |title=War Without Fronts: Atamans and Commissars in Ukraine, 1917–1919 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/11181181 |type=doctoral dissertation |language=en-US |via=Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard |access-date=10 August 2022 |archive-date=3 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403174842/https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/11181181 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In March 1919, the [[Green armies|Green Army]] of local warlord [[Ataman|Otaman]] [[Nykyfor Hryhoriv]] ousted the French and Greek garrison and precipitated the Allied evacuation from [[Odesa]].

==== World War II and post-War period ====
Further devastation and population loss resulted from the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|German occupation]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The German occupation, which lasted from August 1941 to March 1944, contended with both Soviet and Ukrainian nationalist ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]) underground cells. The Kherson district leadership of the OUN was headed by {{ill|Bohdan Bandera|uk|Бандера Богдан Андрійович}} (brother of OUN leader [[Stepan Bandera]]).<ref>Koval'chuk, Vladimir. {{lang|uk|Богдан – загадочный брат Степана Бандеры}} [Bohdan is the mysterious brother of Stepan Bandera]. {{lang|la|День}} [''Dyen'<nowiki/>''], No. 30, 20 February 2009.</ref> The Germans operated a Nazi prison and the Stalag 370 [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|prisoner-of-war camp]] in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=744|title=Gefängnis Cherson|trans-title=Kherson Prison|publisher=The Federal Archives|location=Germany|access-date=7 May 2022|language=de|archive-date=7 May 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220507174021/https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=744|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pegasusarchive.org/pow/Stalag.htm|title=German Camps|access-date=7 May 2022}}</ref>

This changed the city's ethnic composition, increasing the Ukrainian share from 36% in 1926 to 63% in 1959, while reducing the Russian share from 36 to 29%. The Jewish population never recovered from the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] visited by the Germans: accounting for 26% of residents in 1926, their number had fallen to just 6% in 1959.<ref name=":02" />
