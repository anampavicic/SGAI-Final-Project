==History==

===Portuguese rule===
Xai-Xai, formerly João Belo, developed in the early 1900s, under [[Portugal|Portuguese rule]], as a companion port to Lourenço Marques (now [[Maputo]]), though its economic significance was never on par with Mozambique's largest city.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lonely Planet Mozambique |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Mary |year=2007 |publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] |isbn=978-1-74059-188-1 |page=82 }}</ref> Before independence from Portugal in 1975, Xai-Xai was known as João Belo, in the [[Overseas Province of Mozambique]].<ref name=FR>{{cite web| url=https://www.fallingrain.com/world/MZ/02/XaiXai.html |title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Xai-Xai, Mozambique |work=FallingRain Genomics |access-date=2008-06-17}}</ref> João Belo grew and developed under Portuguese rule as a port, agricultural and industrial centre ([[rice]] and [[cashew]] were harvested and processed), a provider of services, including a district hospital and banking, and an administrative centre. Tourism was also important with beaches and hotels.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfUfd-aItuY JOÃO BELO-XAI-XAI], a film of João Belo, Portuguese Mozambique, before 1975.</ref> In 1970, the city had 63,949 inhabitants.

===Post-independence from Portugal===
It was hit hard by [[2000 Mozambique flood|the 2000 Limpopo floods]], caused by four weeks of heavy rainfall accompanying [[Cyclone Leon-Eline]], leaving some buildings {{convert|3|m|0}} under water.<ref name=go2africa>{{cite web |url=http://www.go2africa.com/mozambique/xai-xai |title=Gaza Province » Cities and towns » Xai-Xai |access-date=2008-06-17 |work=go2africa.com }}</ref> However, shortly after the waters receded the town was opened for business again.<ref name=go2africa/>

==Geography==
