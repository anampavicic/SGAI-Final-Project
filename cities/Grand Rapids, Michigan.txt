Located {{Convert|161|mi|km}} northwest of Detroit, Grand Rapids is situated along the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] approximately {{Convert|25|mi|km}} east of [[Lake Michigan]], it is the economic and cultural hub of [[West Michigan]]. A historic furniture manufacturing center, Grand Rapids is home to five of the world's leading office furniture companies and is nicknamed "Furniture City". As a result of the numerous micro and craft breweries, many with notable reputations nationally and globally, Grand Rapids is also known as "Beer City USA". Due to the prominence of the Grand River, many local businesses and civic organizations use the moniker "River City" in their names. The city and surrounding communities are economically diverse, based in the [[health care]], [[information technology]], [[Automotive industry|automotive]], [[aviation]], and consumer goods manufacturing industries, among others.

Grand Rapids was the [[President Gerald R. Ford Jr. Boyhood Home|childhood home]] of U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]], who is buried with his wife [[Betty Ford|Betty]] on the grounds of the [[Gerald R.

==History==
{{Main|History of Grand Rapids, Michigan}}

=== Nineteenth century: Native American and European-American settlement ===
==== Trading post ====
After the French established territories in Michigan, [[Jesuit]] missionaries and traders traveled down Lake Michigan and its tributaries.<ref name="HISTORYlowell">{{cite web |title = A Brief History of Lowell |url = http://kent.migenweb.net/towns/lowell/1931/history.html |website = Kent County Michigan GenWeb Project |publisher = [[Kent County, Michigan|County of Kent]] |access-date = October 2, 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161002190841/http://kent.migenweb.net/towns/lowell/1931/history.html |archive-date = October 2, 2016 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

In 1806, white trader Joseph La Framboise and his [[Métis]] wife, [[Magdelaine Laframboise|Madeline La Framboise]], traveled by canoe from [[Mackinac Island]] and established the first trading post in [[West Michigan]] in present-day Grand Rapids on the banks of the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]], near what is now [[Ada Township, Michigan|Ada Township]], the junction of the Grand and [[Thornapple River]]s. They were French-speaking and [[Roman Catholic]]. They likely both spoke [[Odawa]], Magdelaine's maternal ancestral language. In the fall of 1806, Joseph was fatally stabbed by a member of the [[Potawatomi]] tribe named Nequat. Joseph had been with his family and an entourage of voyageurs traveling between Grand River and Grand Rapids. The Potawatomi man had insisted that Joseph trade liquor with him. When Joseph refused, the man left, only to return at dusk when Joseph, who faithfully performed the ritual of [[Angelus]] every day at that time, was in prayer. Nequat stabbed the trader, fatally wounding him, leaving Joseph's wife, Magdelaine, a [[widow]] at age twenty-four.<ref name="Joseph LaFramboise: A factor of tre">{{cite journal |last1=Timmerman |first1=Janet |title=Joseph LaFramboise: A factor of treaties, trade, and culture |date=2009 }}</ref>

The next spring, a delegation from the Potawatomi tribe brought the offender, Nequat, before Magdelaine for her sentence upon him for the death of her husband. It was their tradition for the victim's family to avenge deaths within that tribe. Magdelaine refused to sentence him and, in an act of forgiveness, told the Potawatomi tribe members to let him go and that God would be his judge. Though Magdelaine had forgiven Nequat, the tribe had not. Nequat's body was found stabbed with his own knife the next season.<ref name="Joseph LaFramboise: A factor of tre"/>

After Joseph's murder while en route to Grand Rapids, Magdelaine La Framboise carried on the trade business, expanding fur trading posts to the west and north, creating a good reputation among the [[American Fur Company]]. La Framboise, whose mother was Odawa and father French, later merged her successful operations with the American Fur Company.<ref name="HISTORYlowell"/>

====Native American settlement====
By 1810, [[Chief Noonday]], or Nowaquakezick, an Odawa chief, established the village of Bock-a-tinck (from ''Baawiting'', "at the rapids") on the northwest side of present-day Grand Rapids near Bridge Street with about 500 Odawa, though the population would grow to over 1,000 on occasion.<ref name="HISTORY1881">{{cite book |title = History of Kent County, Michigan |date = December 1881 |publisher = Chas.

==== European settlement ====
In 1820, General [[Lewis Cass]], who was on his way to negotiate the first [[Treaty of Chicago#1821 Treaty of Chicago|Treaty of Chicago]] with a group of 42 men, commissioned [[Charles Christopher Trowbridge]] to establish missions for Native Americans in the Grand River Valley, in hopes of evangelizing them.<ref name="HISTORY1870">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bad0957.0001.001.umich.edu |title=History and Directory of Kent County, Michigan, Containing a History of Each Township, and the City of Grand Rapids; the Name, Location and Postoffice Address of All Residents Outside of the City: A List of Postoffices in the County; a Schedule of Population; and Other Valuable Statistics |date=November 21, 1870 |publisher=Daily Eagle Steam Printing House |location=Grand Rapids, MI |pages=114–136 <!-- |access-date = September 28, 2016-->}}</ref><ref name=WILD>{{Cite book |last1=Simon-Tibbe |first1=Dorothy |title=Wilderness to Wyoming |last2=Branz |first2=Bill |last3=White |first3=Kelly |publisher=Franklin Press, Inc. |year=2009 |isbn=9780578028583 |edition=1 |location=[[Wyoming, Michigan]] |language=en}}</ref> In 1821, the [[Council of Three Fires]] signed the first [[Treaty of Chicago#1821 Treaty of Chicago|Treaty of Chicago]], ceding to the United States all lands in Michigan Territory south of the Grand River, except for several small reservations, and required a native to prepare land in the area to establish a mission.<ref name="WILD" /><ref name=":5">{{cite web |title=September 26, 1833 – Treaty of Chicago |url=https://www.fcpotawatomi.com/culture-and-history/treaties/september-26-1833-treaty-of-chicago/ |access-date=August 8, 2020 |website=Forest County Potawatomi |archive-date=August 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812205919/https://www.fcpotawatomi.com/culture-and-history/treaties/september-26-1833-treaty-of-chicago/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The treaty also included "One hundred thousand dollars to satisfy sundry individuals, in behalf of whom reservations were asked, which the Commissioners refused to grant" of which Joseph La Framboise received 1,000 dollars immediately and 200 dollars a year, for life.<ref name=":5" /> Madeline La Framboise retired the trading post to [[Rix Robinson]] in 1821 and returned to Mackinac.<ref name="HISTORYlowell" /> That year, Grand Rapids was described as being the home of an Odawa village of about 50 to 60 huts on the north side of the river near the 5th Ward, with Kewkishkam being the village chief and Chief Noonday being the chief of the Odawa.<ref name="HISTORY1870" />

The first permanent European-American settler in the Grand Rapids area was [[Isaac McCoy]], a [[Baptist]] minister.<ref name="HISTORY1870" /> In 1823, McCoy, Paget, a Frenchman who brought along a Native American pupil, and a government worker traveled to Grand Rapids from Carey Mission near present-day [[Niles, Michigan]] to arrange a mission they called the "Thomas Mission", though negotiations fell through with the group returning to the Carey Mission for the Potawatomi on the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]].<ref name="HISTORY1870" /><ref name="WILD" /> The government worker stayed into 1824 to establish a blacksmith shop, though the shop was burned down by the Odawa.<ref name="WILD" /> Later in May 1824, Baptist missionary Reverend Leonard Slater traveled with two settlers to Grand Rapids to perform missionary work, though the group began to return to the Carey Mission after only three days due to threats.<ref name="HISTORY1870"/><ref name="WILD" /> While the group was returning, they encountered Chief Noonday who asked for the group to stay and establish a mission, believing that the Odawa adapting to European customs was the only chance for them to stay in the area.<ref name="WILD" /> The winter of 1824 was difficult, with Slater's group having to resupply and return before the spring.<ref name="WILD" /><ref name="HISTORY1870"/> Chief Noonday, deciding to be an example for the Odawa, chose to be baptized by Slater in the Grand River, though some of his followers believed that this was a wrestling match between the two that Slater won.<ref name="WILD" /> Slater then erected the first settler structures in Grand Rapids, a log cabin for himself and a log schoolhouse.<ref name="HISTORY1870"/> In 1825, McCoy returned and established a missionary station.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Goss |first = Dwight |title = The Indians of the Grand River Valley |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSLiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA178 |journal = Michigan Historical Collections |volume = 30 |pages = 178–80 |year = 1906 |via = Google Books }}</ref> He represented the settlers who began arriving from Ohio, New York and New England, the Yankee states of the Northern Tier.[[File:Grand Rapids 1831.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A sketch of Grand Rapids in 1831.

Shortly after, Detroit-born [[Louis Campau]], known as the official founder of Grand Rapids, was convinced by fur trader William Brewster, who was in a rivalry with the American Fur Company, to travel to Grand Rapids and establish trade there.<ref name="HISTORY1870"/> In 1826, Campau built his cabin, trading post, and blacksmith shop on the south bank of the Grand River near the rapids, stating the Native Americans in the area were "friendly and peaceable".<ref name="HISTORY1870"/> Campau returned to [[Detroit]], then returned a year later with his wife and $5,000 of trade goods to trade with the Odawa and Ojibwa, with the only currency being fur.<ref name="HISTORY1870"/> Campau's younger brother Touissant would often assist him with trade and other tasks at hand.<ref name="HISTORY1870"/>

[[Lucius Lyon]], a Yankee Protestant who would later become a rival to Campau, was contracted by the federal government to survey the Grand River Valley in the fall of 1830 and in the first quarter of 1831.

By 1834, the settlement had become more organized. Rev. Turner had established a school on the east side of the river, with children on the west side of the river being brought to school every morning by a Native American on a canoe who would shuttle them across the river. Multiple events happened at Guild's frame structure, including the first marriage in the city, one that involved his daughter Harriet Guild and Barney Burton, as well as the first town meeting that had nine voters. It was also this year Campau began constructing his own frame building—the largest at the time—near present-day Rosa Parks Circle.<ref name="HISTORY1870"/>

In 1835, many settlers arrived in the area with the population growing to about 50 people, including its first doctor, Dr. Wilson, who was supplied with equipment from Campau.<ref name="HISTORY1870"/> [[Lucius Lyon]], using his knowledge from surveying the area, returned to Grand Rapids to purchase the rest of the prime land and called his plot the Village of Kent.<ref name="HISTORY1870" /><ref name="WILD" /> When Lyon and his partner N. O. Sergeant returned after their purchase, they arrived along with a posse of men carrying shovels and picks, intending to build a [[mill race]]. The group arrived to the music of a bugle which startled the settlement, with Chief Noonday offering Campau assistance to drive back Lyon's posse believing they were invaders. Also that year, Rev. Andrew Vizoisky, a Hungarian native educated in Catholic institutions in Austria, arrived, presiding over the Catholic mission in the area until his death in 1852.<ref name="HISTORY1870"/>

That year, Campau, Rix Robinson, Rev. Slater, and the husband of Chief Noonday's daughter, Meccissininni, traveled to Washington, D.C. to speak about the purchase of Odawa land on the west side of the river with President [[Andrew Jackson]].<ref name="HISTORY1881"/> Jackson was originally unimpressed with Meccissininni, though Meccissininni, who often acquired white customs, asked Jackson for a similar suit to the one the president was wearing. While later wearing his suit that was made similar to Jackson's, Meccissininni also unknowingly imitated Jackson's hat, placing a piece of weed in it, which impressed Jackson since it symbolized mourning the death of his wife.<ref name="HISTORY1881"/>

[[John Ball (pioneer)|John Ball]], representing a group of New York land speculators, bypassed Detroit for a better deal in Grand Rapids traveling to the settlement in 1836.

However, after 1837, the area saw poor times, with many of the French returning to their places of origin, with poverty hitting the area for the next few years.<ref name="HISTORY1870"/>

The first Grand Rapids newspaper, ''The Grand River Times'', was printed on April 18, 1837, describing the village's attributes, stating:<ref name="HISTORY1870"/>

{{blockquote|Though young in its improvements, the site of this village has long been known and esteemed for its natural advantages. It was here that the Indian traders long since made their great depot.}}

''The Grand River Times'' continued, saying the village had grown quickly from a few French families to about 1,200 residents, the Grand River was "one of the most important and delightful to be found in the country," and described the changing Native American culture in the area.<ref name="HISTORY1870"/>

=== Twentieth century: Furniture City ===
Due to its flourishing furniture industry, Grand Rapids began being recognized as "Furniture City". Grand Rapids was also an early center for the [[automobile industry]], as the [[Austin Automobile Company]] operated there from 1901 until 1921.{{wide image|Grand Rapids c1915 6a13439u.jpg|900px|align-cap=center|A 1915 panorama, when the furniture industry peaked before the Great Depression.}}Furniture companies included the William A.

Its industries provided jobs for many new immigrants from Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century, and a Polish neighborhood developed on the west side of the city.

==== Strike of 1911 ====
{{Main|1911 Grand Rapids furniture workers strike}}
[[File:Grand Rapids furniture strike - riot police.jpg|left|thumb|The [[riot police]] who responded to the [[1911 Grand Rapids furniture workers strike]]]]

By the early twentieth century, the quality of furniture produced in Grand Rapids was renowned throughout furniture industry, mainly due to the skill of its workers.<ref name="VIVA" /> Government reports in 1907 revealed that while Grand Rapids lead the industry in product output, its furniture workers were paid lower wages than in other areas.<ref name="VIVA" /> After a minor dispute, workers were inspired to form [[labor union]]s; workers requested furniture companies to increase [[wage]]s, fewer working hours, the creation of [[collective bargaining]] and the institution of a [[minimum wage]] to replace [[piece work]].<ref name=":03" /><ref name="VIVA" /> The furniture businesses refused to respond with unions as they believed that any meeting represented recognition of unions.<ref name=":03" /><ref name="VIVA" />

Workers in Grand Rapids then began a four month long [[general strike]] on April 19, 1911.<ref name=":03" /><ref name="MLIVE12">{{Cite web |last = Martinez |first = Shandra |date = April 3, 2011 |title = Labor strife in Wisconsin reminiscent of great furniture strike of 1911 in Grand Rapids |url = https://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/2011/04/labor_strife_in_wisconsin_remi.html |access-date = August 7, 2021 |website = MLive |language = en |archive-date = June 13, 2021 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210613024159/https://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/2011/04/labor_strife_in_wisconsin_remi.html |url-status = live }}</ref> Much of the public, the mayor, the press and the Catholic diocese supported the strike, believing that the unwillingness of business leaders to negotiate was unjust. Skilled and unskilled factory labor was mainly Dutch (60 percent) and Polish (25 percent), primarily immigrants. According to the 1911 Immigration Commission report, the Dutch had an average of 8 percent higher wages than the Poles even when they did the same work. The pay difference was based on seniority and not ethnicity, but given that the Dutch had arrived earlier, seniority was linked to ethnicity.<ref name=":03" /><ref name="VIVA" /> Ultimately, the Christian Reformed Church – where the majority of Dutch striking workers congregated – and the [[Fountain Street Church]] – led opposition to the strike, which resulted in its end on August 19, 1911.<ref name=":03" /><ref name="MLIVE12" />

The strike spurred substantial changes to the governmental and labor structure of the city.<ref name="MLIVE12" /> With businesses upset with Mayor Ellis for supporting the strike lobbied for the city to change from a twelve-ward government – which more accurately represented the city's ethnic groups – to a smaller three ward system that placed more power into the demands of Dutch citizens, the city's largest demographic.<ref name=":06">{{Cite journal |last = Erdmans |first = Mary Patrice |date = Autumn 2005 |title = The Poles, the Dutch and the Grand Rapids Furniture Strike of 1911 |journal = [[Polish American Studies]] |volume = 62 |issue = 2 |pages = 5–22 |doi = 10.2307/20148725 |jstor = 20148725 |s2cid = 254436229 }}</ref><ref name="MLIVE12"/> Some workers who participated in the strike were [[blacklisted]] by companies and thousands of dissatisfied furniture workers emigrated to higher paying regions.<ref name=":03" /><ref name="VIVA" />

==== Move to retail and suburbanization ====
[[File:Grand Rapids Monroe Center 1965.jpg|thumb|Monroe Center in January 1965, with [[Sears]], [[S. S. Kresge Company]], [[Steketee's]] and Wurzburg's visible]]

Shifting from its furniture-centric industry, downtown Grand Rapids temporarily became a retail destination for the region, hosting four department stores: Herpolsheimer's ([[Lazarus (department store)|Lazarus]]), [[Jacobson's]], [[Steketee's]] (founded in 1862), and Wurzburg's. In 1945, Grand Rapids became the first city in the United States to add [[fluoridation|fluoride]] to its drinking water. National home furnishing conferences were held in Grand Rapids for about seventy-five years, concluding in the 1960s. By that time, the furniture-making industry had largely shifted to [[North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web |title = North Carolina, the Furniture Capital of the World |url = http://www.visitnc.com/story/north-carolina-the-furniture-capital-of-the-world |website = Visit NC |access-date = August 16, 2014 |archive-date = July 30, 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140730180918/https://www.visitnc.com/story/north-carolina-the-furniture-capital-of-the-world |url-status = live }}</ref>

As with many older cities in the United States, retail in the city suffered as the population moved to suburbs in the postwar era, enabled in part by federal subsidies for highway construction. The Grand Rapids suburbs began to develop rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. For example, [[Wyoming, Michigan|Wyoming]] saw rapid growth following the opening of retail outlets such as [[Rogers Plaza]] and Wyoming Village Mall on [[M-11 (Michigan highway)|28th Street]], with some developments built so quickly that they were finished without functioning utilities.<ref name="CVDS77">{{cite book |last1 = Vaughn |first1 = Charles |title = The City of Wyoming: A History |last2 = Simon |first2 = Dorothy |date = 1984 |publisher = Four Corners Press |location = Franklin, Michigan |pages = 77–112 }}</ref> Consolidation of department stores occurred in Grand Rapids and nationally in the 1980s and 1990s.

===Topography===
[[File:Grand Rapids by Sentinel-2.jpg|thumb|The [[Grand Rapids metropolitan area]] taken by the [[Sentinel-2]] satellite in June 2022.]]

Grand Rapids developed on the banks of the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]], where there was once a set of rapids, at an altitude of {{convert|610|ft|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Ships could navigate on the river up to this fall line, stopping because of the rapids. The river valley is flat and narrow, surrounded by steep hills and bluffs. The terrain becomes more rolling hills away from the river. The countryside surrounding the metropolitan area consists of mixed forest and farmland, with large areas of orchards to the northwest. It is approximately {{convert|25|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Lake Michigan]]. The state capital of [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] lies about {{convert|70|mi|abbr=on}} to the east-by-southeast, and [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]] is about {{convert|50|mi|abbr=on}} to the south.

Grand Rapids is divided into four [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrants]], which form a part of mailing addresses in Kent County. The quadrants are NE (northeast), NW (northwest), SE (southeast), and SW (southwest). Fulton Street serves as the north–south dividing line, while Division Avenue serves as the east–west dividing line separating these quadrants.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|45.27|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|44.40|sqmi|sqkm|2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.87|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web |title = US Gazetteer files 2010 |url = https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110220065340/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date = February 20, 2011 |publisher = United States Census Bureau |access-date = November 25, 2012 }}</ref>

The city skyline shows the [[Amway Grand Plaza Hotel]], formerly the Pantlind, which reopened in 1981 after extensive renovations by Marvin DeWinter & Associates. This work included the addition of a 29–story glass tower offering panoramic views of the city, river and surrounding area. The Pantlind Hotel's original architects, Warren & Wetmore, were inspired by the work of the Scottish neoclassical architect [[Robert Adam]]. In its prime, the hotel was rated as one of the top ten hotels in the US. The hotel features several restaurants well known in Grand Rapids. The hotel is owned by Amway Hotel Collection, a subsidiary of Amway's holding company [[Alticor]].<ref>{{cite web |first = Richard L. |last = Johnson |url = http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2004_4th/Oct04_Alticor.html |title = Alticor, Which Owns and Operates the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel, Planning a 300–400 Room Marriott in Downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan / October 2004 |website = Hotel-online.com |date = October 5, 2004 |access-date = August 21, 2017 |archive-date = April 16, 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160416083949/http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2004_4th/Oct04_Alticor.html |url-status = live }}</ref>

Other prominent large buildings include the [[JW Marriott Grand Rapids]], the first JW Marriott Hotel in the Midwest. It is themed from cityscapes of Grand Rapids' sister cities: Omihachiman, Japan; Bielsko-Biała, Poland; Perugia, Italy; Ga District, Ghana; and Zapopan, Mexico. When the hotel opened, Amway Hotel corporation hired photographer Dan Watts to travel to each of the sister cities and photograph them for the property. Each floor of the hotel features photography from one of the cities, which is unique to that floor. Cityscapes of these five cities are alternated in order, up the 23 floors.

In 1973, Grand Rapids hosted ''Sculpture off the Pedestal'', an outdoor exhibition of public sculpture, which assembled works by 13 world-renowned artists, including [[Mark di Suvero]], [[John Raymond Henry|John Henry]], [[Kenneth Snelson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[John Mason (artist)|John Mason]], [[Lyman Kipp]], and [[Stephen Antonakos]], in a single, citywide celebration. ''Sculpture off the Pedestal'' was a public/private partnership, including financial support by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], educational support from the Michigan Council for the Arts, and in-kind contributions from individuals, business, and industry. Fund-raising events, volunteers, and locals housing artists contributed to the public character of the event.

From 1980 to 2015, [[Celebration on the Grand]] was held the weekend after [[Labor Day]], featuring free concerts, fireworks display and food booths. 'Celebration on the Grand' is an event that celebrates life in the Grand River valley.

Along the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] are reconstructed earthwork [[burial mounds]], which were constructed by the prehistoric [[Hopewell culture|Hopewell tribe]]; a [[fish ladder]], and a riverwalk.

Grand Rapids is home to the [[Public Museum of Grand Rapids|Van Andel Museum Center]]. Founded in 1854, it is among the oldest history museums in the United States. The museum's sites include its main building, constructed in 1994 on the west bank of the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] (home to the [[Roger B.

Since the late 20th century, the museum has hosted notable exhibitions, including one on the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], and ''The Quest for Immortality: the Treasures of Ancient Egypt.'' A non-profit institution, it is owned and managed by the Public Museum of Grand Rapids Foundation.[[File:Voight House.jpg|thumb|An example of [[Châteauesque]] architecture in the [[Heritage Hill Historic District (Grand Rapids, Michigan)|Heritage Hill Historic District]], a neighborhood immediately east of downtown]] [[Heritage Hill Historic District (Grand Rapids, Michigan)|Heritage Hill]], a neighborhood directly east of downtown, is one of the largest urban historic districts in the country. The first "neighborhood" of Grand Rapids, its 1,300 homes date from 1848 and represent more than 60 architectural styles. Of particular significance is the [[Meyer May House]], a [[Prairie School|Prairie]]-style home [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] designed in 1908.<ref>{{cite news |last = Grass |first = Michael |date = September 23, 2015 |title = Unsolicited Advice: Forget Beer, Grand Rapids.

The house is now owned and operated by [[Steelcase|Steelcase Corporation]]. Steelcase manufactured the furniture for the [[Johnson Wax Building]] in [[Racine, Wisconsin]], which was also designed by Wright and is recognized as a landmark building. Because of those ties, Steelcase purchased and restored the property in the 1980s. The restoration has been heralded as one of the most accurate and complete of any Wright restoration. The home is used by Steelcase for special events and is open to the public for tours.

The Grand Rapids Barbershop Chapter Great Lakes Chorus is an all-male ''[[a cappella]]'' [[barbershop music|barbershop]] harmony chorus, including quartets. It is one of the oldest chapters in the Barbershop Harmony Society (formally known as the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America, or SPEBSQSA). The Grand Rapids chapter organized on November 1, 1939, for quartet singers; it is credited for holding the first society-sanctioned quartet contest in the "Michigan District" (now Pioneer District) in March 1941.
