==Etymology==
{{See also|Names of European cities in different languages: C–D#D|l1=Other names of Dublin}}

The name ''Dublin'' comes from the [[Middle Irish]] word {{lang|mga|Du(i)blind}} (literally "Blackpool"),<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=Baile Átha Cliath/Dublin |url=https://www.logainm.ie/en/1375542/ |access-date=2024-06-15 |website=logainm.ie |language=en}}</ref> from {{lang|ghc|dubh}} {{IPA-all|d̪ˠuβˠ|}} "black, dark" and {{lang|ghc|linn}} {{IPA-all|l̠ʲin̠ʲ(dʲ)|}} "pool". This evolved into the [[Early Modern Irish]] form {{lang|ghc|Du(i)bhlinn}},<ref name=":2" /> which was pronounced "Duílinn" {{IPA-ga|ˈd̪ˠiːlʲin̠ʲ|}} in the [[Irish language#Leinster|local dialect]]. The name refers to a dark tidal pool on the site of the castle gardens at the rear of [[Dublin Castle]], where the [[River Poddle]] entered the [[River Liffey|Liffey]].

Historically, scribes writing in [[Insular script|Gaelic script]], used a ''b'' with a [[dot (diacritic)|dot]] over it to represent a modern ''bh'', resulting in Du(i)ḃlinn. Those without knowledge of Irish omitted the dot, spelling the name as ''Dublin''.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} The Middle Irish pronunciation is preserved in the names for the city in other languages such as [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|Difelin}}, [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|Dyflin}}, modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] {{lang|is|Dyflinn}} and modern [[Manx language|Manx]] {{lang|gv|Divlyn}} as well as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|Dulyn}} and [[Breton language|Breton]] {{lang|br|Dulenn}}. Other localities in Ireland also bear the name ''Duibhlinn'', variously anglicised as Devlin,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logainm.ie/en/14364 |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Duibhlinn/Devlin |access-date=13 September 2013 |archive-date=7 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107003050/http://www.logainm.ie/en/14364%20 |url-status=live }}</ref> Divlin<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logainm.ie/en/13534 |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Béal Duibhlinne/Ballydivlin |access-date=13 September 2013 |archive-date=7 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107002937/http://www.logainm.ie/en/13534%20 |url-status=live }}</ref> and Difflin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logainm.ie/en/16486 |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Duibhlinn/Difflin |access-date=13 September 2013 |archive-date=7 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107003031/http://www.logainm.ie/en/16486%20 |url-status=live }}</ref> Variations on the name are also found in traditionally Gaelic-speaking areas of [[Scotland]] ([[Gàidhealtachd]], cognate with Irish [[Gaeltacht]]), such as {{lang|gd|An Linne Dhubh}} ("the black pool"), which is part of [[Loch Linnhe]].

It is now thought that the Viking settlement was preceded by a Christian ecclesiastical settlement known as ''Duibhlinn'', from which ''Dyflin'' took its name.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Dublin, the making of a metropolis|last=Clarke|first=Howard|publisher=Irish Academic Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0716524595|page=44}}</ref> Beginning in the 9th and 10th centuries, there were two settlements where the modern city stands. The Viking settlement of about 841, ''Dyflin'', and a Gaelic settlement, Áth Cliath ("ford of hurdles")<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Palgrave Handbook of Literature and the City|last=Tambling|first=Jeremy|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2017|isbn=978-1137549105|page=98}}</ref> further up the river, at the present-day [[Father Mathew Bridge]] (also known as Dublin Bridge), at the bottom of Church Street.

{{lang|ga|Baile Átha Cliath}}, meaning "town of the hurdled [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]", is the common name for the city in Modern Irish, which is often contracted to {{lang|ga|Bleá Cliath}} or {{lang|ga|Blea Cliath}} when spoken.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.logainm.ie/ga/1375542| title=Dublin/Baile Átha Cliath – Placenames Database of Ireland| access-date=4 August 2022| quote=Baile Átha: almost invariably throughout Ireland is pronounced as if written Blah as B.A Claith - Blaclia; Blá Cliath; Baile Átha Cliath...a name shortened into Blea Cliath| archive-date=12 August 2022| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220812230317/https://www.logainm.ie/ga/1375542| url-status=live}}</ref> {{lang|ga|Áth Cliath}} is a place name referring to a fording point of the River Liffey near Father Mathew Bridge. ''{{lang|ga|Baile Átha Cliath}}'' was an early Christian monastery, believed to have been in the area of Aungier Street, currently occupied by [[Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church]]. There are other towns of the same name, such as ''Àth Cliath'' in [[East Ayrshire]], Scotland, which is anglicised as [[Hurlford]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Dublin}}
{{For timeline|Timeline of Dublin}}

The area of [[Dublin Bay]] has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times; fish traps discovered from excavations during the construction of the [[Convention Centre Dublin]] indicate human habitation as far back as 6,000 years ago. Further traps were discovered closer to the old settlement of the city of Dublin on the [[Dublin quays|south quays]] near [[St. James's Gate]] which also indicate [[mesolithic]] human activity.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ryan |first1=Danielle |title=Archaeologists find ancient fish trap at Dublin quays site |url=https://www.thejournal.ie/fish-basket-victoria-quay-diageo-site-997693-Jul2013/ |website=[[TheJournal.ie]] |date=19 July 2013 |access-date=9 December 2021 |language=en |archive-date=9 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211209144402/https://www.thejournal.ie/fish-basket-victoria-quay-diageo-site-997693-Jul2013/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=2007:494 - Spencer Dock, North Wall Quay, Dublin, Dublin |url=https://excavations.ie/report/2007/Dublin/0017470/ |website=excavations.ie |access-date=9 December 2021 |archive-date=9 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211209143857/https://excavations.ie/report/2007/Dublin/0017470/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Ptolemy's map of Ireland]], of about 140 AD, provides possibly the earliest reference to a settlement near Dublin.

Beginning in the 9th and 10th centuries, there were two settlements which later became modern Dublin. The subsequent Scandinavian settlement centred on the [[River Poddle]], a tributary of the Liffey in an area now known as [[Wood Quay]]. The Dubhlinn was a pool on the lowest stretch of the Poddle, where ships used to moor. This pool was finally fully infilled during the early 18th century, as the city grew. The Dubhlinn lay where the Castle Garden is now located, opposite the [[Chester Beatty Library]] within [[Dublin Castle]]. ''[[Táin Bó Cuailgne]]'' ("The Cattle Raid of Cooley") refers to ''Dublind rissa ratter Áth Cliath'', meaning "Dublin, which is called Ath Cliath".

Dublin was the heart of the area known as [[the Pale]], a narrow strip of English settlement along the eastern coast, under the control of the [[English Crown]]. The [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] in the 16th century spelt a new era for Dublin, with the city enjoying a renewed prominence as the centre of administrative rule in Ireland where English control and settlement had become much more extensive. Determined to make Dublin a Protestant city, Queen [[Elizabeth I]] established [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]] in 1592 as a solely Protestant university and ordered that the Catholic [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] cathedrals be converted to the Protestant church. The earliest map of the city of Dublin dates from 1610, and was by [[John Speed]].{{sfn|Maxwell|1997|p=56-57}}

The city had a population of 21,000 in 1640 before a plague from 1649 to 1651 wiped out almost half of the inhabitants. However, the city prospered again soon after as a result of the wool and linen trade with England and reached a population of over 50,000 in 1700.<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gI8MYY6ASdcC&pg=PA34 Dublin: a cultural history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801035433/https://books.google.com/books?id=gI8MYY6ASdcC&pg=PA34 |date=1 August 2020 }}''".

===Early modern===
[[File:Henrietta Street, Dublin D1.jpg|thumb|[[Henrietta Street, Dublin|Henrietta Street]], developed in the 1720s, is the earliest [[Georgian Dublin|Georgian street]] in Dublin.]]
As the city continued to prosper during the 18th century, [[Georgian Dublin]] became, for a short period, the second-largest city of the [[British Empire]] and the fifth largest city in Europe, with the population exceeding 130,000. While some medieval streets and layouts (including the areas around [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]], Aungier Street, Capel Street and Thomas Street) were less affected by the wave of Georgian reconstruction, much of Dublin's architecture and layout dates from this period.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dublin's Buildings |website=Dublin Civic Trust |url=http://www.dublincivictrust.ie/dublins-buildings |access-date=29 December 2021 |archive-date=29 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211229213823/http://www.dublincivictrust.ie/dublins-buildings |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.architectural-review.com/buildings/dublin-renaissance | publisher = The Architectural Review | website = architectural-review.com | title = Dublin Renaissance | date = 1993 | quote = [while] the impossibly bureaucratic sounding Wide Streets Commissioners [..] cut broad, ersatz boulevard swathes through the dense urban grain to create Parliament Street, Dame Street and Westmoreland Street [..] The minor streets of Temple Bar, originally little more than mean alleyways, have evolved over time | access-date = 29 December 2021 | archive-date = 29 December 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211229223345/https://www.architectural-review.com/buildings/dublin-renaissance | url-status = live }}</ref>{{sfn|Maxwell|1997|p=220}}

Dublin grew even more dramatically during the 18th century, with the construction of many new districts and buildings, such as [[Merrion Square]], [[Irish Houses of Parliament|Parliament House]] and the [[City Hall, Dublin|Royal Exchange]]. The [[Wide Streets Commission]] was established in 1757 at the request of [[Dublin Corporation]] to govern architectural standards on the layout of streets, bridges and buildings.{{sfn|Maxwell|1997|p=58-59}} In 1759, the [[Guinness brewery]] was founded, and would eventually grow to become the largest brewery in the world and the largest employer in Dublin.<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b-tFDwAAQBAJ&q=guinness+%22largest+employer%22&pg=PT12 | publisher = Collins Press | title = Stones of Dublin | author = Lisa Marie Griffith | date = 2014 | quote = ''[Guinness] was Dublin's largest brewery in 1810, Ireland's largest in 1833, and the largest in the world by 1914.

Dublin suffered a period of political and economic decline during the 19th century following the [[Acts of Union 1800]], under which the seat of government was transferred to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]] in London. The city played no major role in the [[Industrial Revolution]], but remained the centre of administration and a transport hub for most of the island. Ireland had no significant sources of coal, the fuel of the time, and Dublin was not a centre of ship manufacturing, the other main driver of industrial development in Britain and Ireland.<ref name="Davies"/> [[Belfast]] developed faster than Dublin during this period on a mixture of international trade, factory-based linen cloth production and shipbuilding.<ref name="Lyons">{{cite book | last = Lyons | first = F.S.L. | author-link = F.

[[File:The shell of the G.P.O. on Sackville Street after the Easter Rising (6937669789).jpg|thumb|Damage in Dublin city centre following the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] with the ruins of the GPO to the left]]
The [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, the [[Irish War of Independence]], and the subsequent [[Irish Civil War]] resulted in a significant amount of physical destruction in central Dublin. The [[Government of the Irish Free State]] rebuilt the city centre and located the new parliament, the [[Oireachtas]], in [[Leinster House]]. Since the beginning of [[Normans|Norman]] rule in the 12th century, the city has functioned as the capital in varying geopolitical entities: [[Lordship of Ireland]] (1171–1541), [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1541–1800), as part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (1801–1922), and the [[Irish Republic]] (1919–1922). Following the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1922, it became the capital of the [[Irish Free State]] (1922–1937) and now is the capital of Ireland. One of the memorials to commemorate that time is the [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]].

Dublin was also a victim of the Northern Irish [[The Troubles|Troubles]], although during this 30-year conflict, violence mainly occurred within Northern Ireland. A Loyalist paramilitary group, the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]], bombed the city during this time – notably in an atrocity known as the [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]] in which 34 people died, mainly in central Dublin.

Large parts of Georgian Dublin were demolished or substantially redeveloped in the mid-20th century during a boom in office building. After this boom, the recessions of the 1970s and 1980s slowed down the pace of building. Cumulatively, this led to a large decline in the number of people living in the centre of the city, and by 1985 the city had approximately 150 acres of derelict land which had been earmarked for development and {{Convert | 10 | e6sqft | sigfig = 1 | abbr=off}} of office space.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McDonald|first=Frank|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60079186|title=The destruction of Dublin|date=1985|publisher=Gill and Macmillan|isbn=0-7171-1386-8|location=Dublin|pages=332|oclc=60079186|access-date=27 January 2021|archive-date=24 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210924144503/https://www.worldcat.org/title/destruction-of-dublin/oclc/60079186|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Council passes an annual budget for spending on areas such as housing, traffic management, refuse, drainage, and planning. The Dublin City Manager is responsible for implementing City Council decisions but also has considerable executive power.

As the capital city, Dublin is the seat of the national parliament of Ireland, the [[Oireachtas]]. It is composed of the [[President of Ireland]], [[Dáil Éireann]] as the house of representatives, and [[Seanad Éireann]] as the upper house. The President resides in [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] in [[Phoenix Park]], while both houses of the Oireachtas meet in [[Leinster House]], a former ducal residence on [[Kildare Street]]. It has been the home of the Irish parliament since the foundation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922. The old [[Irish Houses of Parliament]] of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], which dissolved in 1801, are located in [[College Green, Dublin|College Green]].

[[Government Buildings]] house the [[Department of the Taoiseach]], the Council Chamber, the Department of Finance and the [[Attorney General of Ireland|Office of the Attorney General]]. It consists of a main building (completed 1911) with two wings (completed 1921). It was designed by Thomas Manley Dean and Sir [[Aston Webb]] as the [[Royal College of Science (Ireland)|Royal College of Science]]. The [[First Dáil]] originally met in the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]] in 1919. The Irish Free State government took over the two wings of the building to serve as a temporary home for some ministries, while the central building became the College of Technology until 1989.<ref>Department of the Taoiseach: Guide to Government Buildings (2005)</ref> Although both it and Leinster House were intended to be temporary locations, they became the permanent homes of parliament from then on.

The Liffey bends at [[Leixlip]] from a northeasterly route to a predominantly eastward direction, and this point also marks the transition to urban development from more agricultural land usage.<ref name="erdb">{{cite web |title = Final Characterisation Report  |url = http://erbd.ie/upload/files/Characterisation%20Report.pdf |publisher = Eastern River Basin District |at = Sec. 7: Characterisation of the Liffey Catchment Area  |access-date = 10 November 2014 |archive-date = 7 January 2019 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190107002633/http://erbd.ie/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi |url-status = live}}</ref> The city itself was founded where the [[River Poddle]] met the Liffey, and the early Viking settlement was also facilitated by the small [[Steine of Dublin|Steine]] or Steyne River, the larger Camac<ref name="LittleRvrs-Camac">{{cite journal |last1=O'Brennan |first1=Lily M. |title=Little Rivers of Dublin |journal=Dublin Historical Record |date=1 September 1940 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=24–25 |jstor=30083879 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30083879 |access-date=13 January 2021 |archive-date=10 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220210140408/https://www.jstor.org/stable/30083879 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the Bradogue,<ref name="LittleRvrs-Brad">{{cite journal |last1=O'Brennan |first1=Lily M. |title=Little Rivers of Dublin |journal=Dublin Historical Record |date=1 September 1940 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=23–24 |jstor=30083879 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30083879 |access-date=13 January 2021 |archive-date=10 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220210140408/https://www.jstor.org/stable/30083879 |url-status=live }}</ref> in particular.

Two secondary rivers further divide the city: the [[River Tolka]], running southeast into Dublin Bay, and the [[River Dodder]] running northeast to near the mouth of the Liffey, and these and the Liffey have multiple tributaries. A number of lesser rivers and streams also flow to the sea within the suburban parts of the city.<ref name="TenDoz_rivers_sml_sea">{{cite book |last1=Doyle |first1=Joseph W. |title=Ten Dozen Waters: The Rivers and Streams of County Dublin |date=2013 |publisher=Rath Eanna Research |location=Dublin, Ireland |isbn=9780956636362 |edition=7th}}</ref>

Two canals&nbsp;– the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] on the southside and the [[Royal Canal of Ireland|Royal Canal]] on the northside&nbsp;– ring the inner city on their way from the west, both connecting with the [[River Shannon]].

===Climate===
Similar to much of the rest of northwestern Europe, Dublin experiences a [[maritime climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|''Cfb'']]) with mild-warm summers, cool winters, and a lack of temperature extremes. At [[Merrion Square]], the coldest month is February, with an average minimum temperature of {{convert|4.1|C|F|abbr=on}}, and the warmest month is July, with an average maximum temperature of {{convert|20.1|C|F|abbr=on}}. Due to the [[urban heat island]] effect, Dublin city has the warmest summertime nights in Ireland. The average minimum temperature at Merrion Square in July is {{convert|13.5|C|F|abbr=on}}, and the lowest July temperature ever recorded at the station was {{convert|7.8|C|F|abbr=on}} on 3 July 1974.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data|title=Historical Data: DUBLIN (MERRION SQUARE) - Station No. 3923|publisher=Met Éireann|access-date=9 June 2022|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624195529/https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data|url-status=live}}</ref>

The highest temperature officially recorded in Dublin is {{cvt|33.1|C}} on 18 July 2022, at the [[Phoenix Park]]. A non-official record of {{cvt|33.5|C}} was also recorded at Phoenix Park in July 1876<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Dooley |first1=Katherine |last2=Kelly |first2=Ciaran |last3=Seifert |first3=Natascha |last4=Myslinski |first4=Therese |last5=O'Kelly |first5=Sophie |last6=Siraj |first6=Rushna |last7=Crosby |first7=Ciara |last8=Dunne |first8=Jack Kevin |last9=McCauley |first9=Kate |last10=Donoghue |first10=James |last11=Gaddren |first11=Eoin |last12=Conway |first12=Daniel |last13=Cooney |first13=Jordan |last14=McCarthy |first14=Niamh |last15=Cullen |first15=Eoin |date=2023-01-03 |title=Reassessing long-standing meteorological records: an example using the national hottest day in Ireland |url=https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/53027 |journal=Climate of the Past |language=en |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |doi=10.5194/cp-19-1-2023 |doi-access=free |bibcode=2023CliPa..19....1D |issn=1814-9332}}</ref>

Dublin's sheltered location on the east coast makes it the driest place in Ireland, receiving only about half the rainfall of the west coast. [[Ringsend]] in the south of the city records the lowest rainfall in the country, with an average annual precipitation of {{convert|683|mm|0|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web |publisher=European Climate Assessment & Dataset |title=Climatology details for station DUBLIN (RINGSEND), IRELAND and index RR: Precipitation sum |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1981-2010&indexid=RR&stationid=1958 |access-date=21 December 2012 |archive-date=1 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201182200/http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1981-2010&indexid=RR&stationid=1958 |url-status=live }}</ref> with the average annual precipitation in the city centre being {{convert|726|mm|0|abbr=on}}. At Merrion Square, the wettest year and driest year on record occurred within 5 years of each other, with 1953 receiving just {{convert|463.1|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall, while 1958 recorded {{convert|1022.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="auto"/> The main precipitation in winter is rain; however snow showers do occur between November and March. Hail is more common than snow. Strong Atlantic winds are most common in autumn. These winds can affect Dublin, but due to its easterly location, it is least affected compared to other parts of the country. However, in winter, easterly winds render the city colder and more prone to snow showers.

The city experiences long summer days and short winter days. Based on satellite observations, [[Met Éireann]] estimates that Dublin's coastal areas typically receive over 1,600 hours of sunshine per year,<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Met Éireann |title=Sunshine and Solar Radiation |url=https://www.met.ie/climate/what-we-measure/sunshine |access-date=2 May 2024 }}</ref> with the climate getting progressively duller inland. Dublin airport, located north of city and about {{Convert|10|km|mi}} from the coast, records an average of 1,485 hours of sunshine per year. The station at Dublin airport has been maintaining climate records since November 1941. The sunniest year on record was 1,740 hours in 1959, and the dullest year was 1987 with 1,240 hours of sunshine. The lowest amount of monthly sunshine on record was 16.4 hours in January 1996, while the highest was 305.9 hours in July 1955.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Met Éireann |title=Historical Data - Monthly Average (1941-present) - Dublin Airport (mly532)  |url=https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data |access-date=2 May 2024 }}</ref>

In the 20th century, smog and air-pollution were an issue in the city, precipitating a ban on bituminous fuels across Dublin.<ref name="coalbangov">{{cite web | url = https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/environment/topics/air-quality/smoky-coal-ban/Pages/default.aspx | publisher = Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment | title = Smoky coal ban | access-date = 1 January 2018 | archive-date = 7 January 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190107003053/https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/environment/topics/air-quality/smoky-coal-ban/Pages/default.aspx%20 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="coalbantimes">{{cite news |url = https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/how-the-coal-ban-dealt-with-dublin-s-burning-issue-1.2367021 |newspaper = [[The Irish Times]] |title = How the coal ban dealt with Dublin's burning issue |date = 26 September 2015 |access-date = 22 February 2017 |archive-date = 23 February 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170223125126/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/how-the-coal-ban-dealt-with-dublin-s-burning-issue-1.2367021 |url-status = live }}</ref> The ban was implemented in 1990 to address black smoke concentrations, that had been linked to cardiovascular and respiratory deaths in residents.

===Landmarks===
{{Further|List of public art in Dublin}}
Dublin has many landmarks and monuments dating back hundreds of years. One of the oldest is [[Dublin Castle]], which was first founded as a major defensive work on the orders of England's [[John, King of England|King John]] in 1204, shortly after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169, when it was commanded that a castle be built with strong walls and good ditches for the defence of the city, the administration of justice, and the protection of the King's treasure.<ref name="history">{{cite book|last= McCarthy|first= Denis |author2=Benton, David |year= 2004|title= Dublin Castle: at the heart of Irish History|location= Dublin|publisher=Irish Government Stationery Office |pages= 12–18|isbn= 978-0-7557-1975-4}}</ref> Largely complete by 1230, the castle was of typical Norman courtyard design, with a central square without a [[keep]], bounded on all sides by tall defensive walls and protected at each corner by a circular tower. Sited to the south-east of Norman Dublin, the castle formed one corner of the outer perimeter of the city, using the [[River Poddle]] as a natural means of defence.

One of Dublin's most prominent landmarks is the [[Spire of Dublin]], officially entitled the "Monument of Light."<ref>{{cite news

The park is also home to [[Dublin Zoo]], [[Ashtown Castle]], and the official residence of the [[United States Ambassador to Ireland|United States Ambassador]]. Music concerts are also sometimes held in the park.

St Stephen's Green is adjacent to one of Dublin's main shopping streets, [[Grafton Street, Dublin|Grafton Street]], and to [[Stephen's Green Shopping Centre|a shopping centre named after it]], while on its surrounding streets are the offices of a number of public bodies.

[[Saint Anne's Park]] is a public park and recreational facility, shared between [[Raheny]] and [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]], both suburbs on the Northside. The park, the second largest municipal park in Dublin, is part of a former {{convert|2|km²|sqmi acre|sigfig=1|adj=on}} estate assembled by members of the [[Guinness family]], beginning with [[Benjamin Lee Guinness]] in 1835. The largest municipal park is adjacent (North) [[Bull Island]], also shared between Clontarf and Raheny, featuring a 5&nbsp;km beach, Dollymount Strand.

===City boundaries===
From 1842, the boundaries of the city were comprehended by the [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Dublin City and the barony of [[Dublin (barony)|Dublin]]. Over time, the city has absorbed area previously administered as part of County Dublin (now the three counties of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin), with a change in 1985 also returning areas to the county.

A number of Dublin's traditional industries, such as food processing, textile manufacturing, brewing, and distilling have gradually declined, although [[Guinness]] has been brewed at the [[St. James's Gate Brewery]] since 1759. Economic improvements in the 1990s attracted a number of global pharmaceutical, information and communications technology companies to the city and Greater Dublin Area. Companies such as [[Microsoft]], [[Google]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[eBay]], [[PayPal]], [[Yahoo!]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Accenture]], [[TikTok]] and [[Pfizer]] now have European headquarters or operational bases in the city with several located in enterprise clusters like the [[The Digital Hub|Digital Hub]] and [[Silicon Docks]]. The presence of these companies has driven economic expansion in the city and led to Dublin sometimes being referred to as the "Tech Capital of Europe".<ref name=":0" />

Financial services have also become important to the city since the establishment of Dublin's [[International Financial Services Centre, Dublin|International Financial Services Centre]] in 1987. More than 500 operations are approved to trade under the IFSC programme. The centre is host to half of the world's top 50 banks and to half of the top 20 insurance companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifsc.ie/page.aspx?idpage=6 |title=I.F.S.C |publisher=I.F.S.C.ie |date=21 June 2010 |access-date=21 January 2010 |archive-date=24 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224233819/https://www.ifsc.ie/page.aspx?idpage=6 |url-status=live }}</ref> Many international firms have established major headquarters in the city, such as [[Citibank]]. The [[Irish Stock Exchange]] (ISEQ), [[Internet Neutral Exchange]] (INEX) and Irish Enterprise Exchange (IEX) are also located in Dublin. Dublin has been positioned as one of the main cities vying to host Financial Services companies hoping to retain access to the Eurozone after [[Brexit]]. The Celtic Tiger also led to a temporary boom in construction, with large redevelopment projects in the [[Dublin Docklands]] and [[Spencer Dock]]. Completed projects include the [[Convention Centre Dublin|Convention Centre]], the [[3Arena]], and the [[Bord Gáis Energy Theatre]].

As of 2024, the [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product]] of Dublin is €253.6 billion, meaning it has one of the biggest city economies in the [[European Union]].

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Dublin}}

===Road===
[[File:DublinM50.png|thumb|The [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50 motorway]] surrounding Dublin]]
The road network in Ireland is primarily focused on Dublin. The [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50 motorway]], a semi-[[ring road]] which runs around the south, west and north of the city, connects important national primary routes to the rest of the country. In 2008, the [[West-Link]] toll bridge was replaced by the [[eFlow]] barrier-free tolling system, with a three-tiered charge system based on electronic tags and car pre-registration.<ref>{{cite web | title = EFlow Website | publisher = eFlow | url = http://eflow.ie/ | access-date = 29 July 2011 | archive-date = 11 August 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200811033751/https://www.eflow.ie/ | url-status = live }}</ref>

The first phase of a proposed eastern bypass for the city is the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]], which officially opened in 2006 to mainly cater for heavy vehicles. The tunnel connects [[Dublin Port]] and the [[M1 motorway (Republic of Ireland)|M1 motorway]] close to Dublin Airport. The city is also surrounded by an inner and outer orbital route. The inner orbital route runs approximately around the heart of the Georgian city and the outer orbital route runs primarily along the natural circle formed by Dublin's two canals, the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] and the [[Royal Canal of Ireland|Royal Canal]], as well as the North and South Circular Roads.

The 2016 [[TomTom]] Traffic Index ranked Dublin the 15th most congested city in the world and the 7th most congested in Europe.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kelpie|first1=Colm|title=Revealed: Dublin ranked worse than London or Paris for road congestion|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/revealed-dublin-ranked-worse-than-london-or-paris-for-road-congestion-34563994.html|access-date=20 December 2016|work=The Irish Independent|date=23 March 2016|archive-date=29 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129063735/http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/revealed-dublin-ranked-worse-than-london-or-paris-for-road-congestion-34563994.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TomTom Traffic Index|url=https://www.tomtom.com/en_ie/trafficindex/list|website=TomTom|access-date=20 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329034844/http://tomtom.com/en_ie/trafficindex/list|archive-date=29 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Bus====
Dublin is served by a network of nearly 200 bus routes which cover the city and suburbs. The majority of these are provided by [[Dublin Bus]], with a modest number having been transferred to Go Ahead Ireland in 2018. A number of smaller companies also operate. Fares are generally calculated on a stage system based on distance travelled. There are several different levels of fares, which apply on most services. A "Real Time Passenger Information" system was introduced at Dublin Bus bus stops in 2012 in which signs relay display the projected time of the next buses' arrival based on its GPS position. The [[National Transport Authority (Ireland)|National Transport Authority]] is responsible for integration of bus and rail services in Dublin and has been involved in introducing a pre-paid smart card, called a [[TFI Leap Card]], which can be used on all of Dublin's public transport services.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ticketing|url=https://www.nationaltransport.ie/transport-technology/transport-technology-ticketing/|access-date=1 February 2022|website=National Transport|language=en-US|archive-date=1 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220201161136/https://www.nationaltransport.ie/transport-technology/transport-technology-ticketing/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[BusConnects]] programme includes a number of proposed improvements to Dublin's bus network, including new spine and orbital routes. The spine routes are intended to increase the frequency of buses along major corridors, and the orbital routes aim to "provide connections between suburbs and town centres, without having to travel into the City Centre".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dublin Network Redesign |url=https://busconnects.ie/cities/dublin/new-dublin-area-bus-network |access-date=2023-12-06 |website=Busconnects |language=en-US}}</ref> In 2022, Dublin Bus began the process of electrifying its fleet with new [[Battery electric bus|battery-powered buses]], with plans for 85% of Dublin buses to be zero-emission by 2032.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dublin Bus - Transport Minister, NTA and Dublin Bus unveil electric bus charging infrastructure |url=https://www.dublinbus.ie/news/transport-minister,-nta-and-dublin-bus-unveil-electric-bus-charging-infrastructure |access-date=2023-12-06 |website=Dublin Bus |language=en |archive-date=7 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231207180230/https://www.dublinbus.ie/news/transport-minister,-nta-and-dublin-bus-unveil-electric-bus-charging-infrastructure |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Cycling====
[[File:Dublin Bikes.jpg|thumb|[[Dublinbikes]] terminal in the [[Dublin Docklands|Docklands]]]]
The [[2011 census of Ireland|2011 census]] indicated that 5.9% of commuters in Dublin cycled. A 2013 report by Dublin City Council on traffic flows crossing the canals in and out of the city found that just under 10% of all traffic was made up of cyclists, representing an increase of 14.1% over 2012 and an 87.2% increase over 2006 levels. The increase was attributed to measures such as the Dublinbikes bike rental scheme, the provision of cycle lanes, public awareness campaigns to promote cycling and the introduction of the 30&nbsp;km/h city centre speed limit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content//RoadsandTraffic/Traffic/Documents/Canal_Cordon_Counts_2013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903221013/http://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content//RoadsandTraffic/Traffic/Documents/Canal_Cordon_Counts_2013.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 September 2015 |title=Report on trends in mode share of vehicles and people crossing the Canal Cordon 2006 to 2013 |year=2013 |publisher=[[Dublin City Council]] & National Transport Authority |pages=4, 8, 16 |access-date=29 August 2015 }}</ref>

===Rail===
[[File:LUAS trams at Tallaght terminus. - geograph.org.uk - 1387090.jpg|thumb|[[Luas]] trams at the [[Tallaght]] terminus]]
[[Dublin Heuston railway station|Heuston]] and [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Connolly]] stations are the two main railway termini in Dublin. Operated by [[Iarnród Éireann]], the [[Dublin Suburban Rail]] network consists of five railway lines serving the Greater Dublin Area and commuter towns such as [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] in County Louth, [[Gorey]] in [[County Wexford]], and extending as far as [[Portlaoise]] in County Laois, and once a day to [[Newry]]. One of the five lines is the electrified [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) line, which runs primarily along the coast of Dublin, comprising 31 stations, from [[Malahide]] and [[Howth]] southwards as far as [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]] and [[Greystones]] in County Wicklow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublin.ie/transport/dart.htm|title=DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit)|access-date=28 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721123858/http://www.dublin.ie/transport/dart.htm|archive-date=21 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Commuter (Irish Rail)|Commuter rail]] operates on the other four lines using Irish Rail [[diesel multiple unit]]s.

==English and Irish languages==
Dublin was traditionally a city of two languages, English and [[Irish language|Irish]], a situation found also in the area around it, [[the Pale]]. The Irish of County Dublin represented the easternmost extension of a broad central dialect area which stretched between Leinster and [[Connacht]], but had its own local characteristics. It may also have been influenced by the east [[Ulster]] dialect of [[County Meath]] and [[County Louth]] to the north.<ref>Williams, Nicholas.

English authorities of the Cromwellian period accepted the fact that Irish was widely spoken in the city and its surrounds. In 1655 several local dignitaries were ordered to oversee a lecture in Irish to be given in Dublin. In March 1656 a converted Catholic priest, Séamas Corcy, was appointed to preach in Irish at Bride's parish every Sunday, and was also ordered to preach at [[Drogheda]] and [[Athy]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Berresford Ellis | first = Peter | date = 1975 | title = Hell or Connaught!

===Current era===
The native language of most Dubliners today is English, and several local dialects are subsumed under the label [[Dublin English]]. Dublin also has many thousands of habitual Irish speakers, with the [[2016 census of Ireland|2016 census]] showing that daily speakers (outside the education system) numbered 14,903. They form part of an urban Irish-speaking cohort which is generally better-educated than monoglot English speakers.<ref>{{cite web| publisher = Central Statistics Office | work = Census of Population 2016 | title = Profile 10 Education, Skills and the Irish Language |url = https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/ilg/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201208225214/https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/ilg/ |archive-date=8 December 2020 }}</ref>

The Dublin Irish-speaking cohort is supported by a number of Irish-medium schools. There are 12,950 students in the Dublin region attending 34 [[gaelscoil]]eanna (Irish-language primary schools) and 10 [[Gaelcholáiste|gaelcholáistí]] (Irish-language secondary schools).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/files/Education-through-Irish.pdf|title=Education through the Medium of Irish 2015/2016|year=2016|publisher=gaelscoileanna.ie|access-date=1 January 2018|archive-date=1 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101135552/http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/files/Education-through-Irish.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Two Irish language radio stations, [[Raidió Na Life]] and [[RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta]], have studios in the city, and the online station [[Raidió Rí-Rá]] broadcasts from studios in the city. A number of Irish language agencies are also located in the capital. {{Lang|ga|[[Conradh na Gaeilge]]}} offers language classes and is used as a meeting place for different groups.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}} The closest Gaeltacht to Dublin is the [[County Meath]] [[Gaeltacht]] of [[Ráth Cairn]] and [[Baile Ghib]] which is {{convert|55|km|0|abbr=on}} away.

==International relations==
Dublin city council has an International Relations Unit, established in 2007. It works on hosting of international delegations, staff exchanges, international promotion of the city, twinning and partnerships, work with multi-city organisations such as [[Eurocities]], economic partnerships and advice to other Council units.<ref name="DCC_IntlRels">{{cite web |title=International Relations |url=http://www.dublincity.ie/main-menu-services-recreation-culture/international-relations-unit |website=Dublin City Council |access-date=29 May 2020 |archive-date=7 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107002933/http://www.dublincity.ie/main-menu-services-recreation-culture/international-relations-unit%20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
