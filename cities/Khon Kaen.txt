'''Khon Kaen''' ({{langx|th|ขอนแก่น}}, {{IPA|th|kʰɔ̌(ː)n kɛ̀n|pron}}) is the capital of [[Khon Kaen province]] and the [[List of municipalities in Thailand#Largest cities by urban population|fourth-largest city]] in [[Thailand]]. It is one of the four major cities of [[Isan]], Northeast Thailand, also known as the "big four of Isan", the others being [[Udon Thani]], [[Nakhon Ratchasima]], and [[Ubon Ratchathani]]. 

The city municipality of Khon Kaen (''[[Thesaban|thesaban nakhon]]'') acts as the governmental seat of the [[Khon Kaen province|province]], as well as the [[Mueang Khon Kaen district]] and lies {{convert|450.|km|mi}} northeast of Bangkok.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Distance: Bangkok to Khon Kaen |url=https://www.google.co.th/search?q=distance+bangkok+to+kalasin&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr,ssl&ei=_xuMVZ3jOY-9ugTZ-KyoAQ#q=distance+bangkok+to+Khon+Kaen |access-date=25 June 2015 |website=Google Maps}}</ref>

==Geography and demography==
Khon Kaen is on the [[Khorat Plateau]], elevation 187 m,<ref name="RID" /> and is the center of the mid-northeastern provincial group of Thailand, according to the Thai government. Its coordinates are {{coord|16|26|N|102|50|E|}}. The city municipality has a population of 114,459,<ref name="TDD" /> while the [[Mueang Khon Kaen district]], forming the city's urban area, has a population of 412,758.<ref>{{Cite web |title=สำนักบริหารการทะเบียน – The Bureau of Registration Administration (BORA), Department of Provincial Administration (DOPA), Population data for the year 2022 |url=https://www.bora.dopa.go.th/ |access-date=2023-06-21 |language=th}}</ref> Khon Kaen therefore ranks as the [[List of municipalities in Thailand#Largest cities by urban population|fourth-largest city]] in Thailand after [[Bangkok]], [[Chiang Mai]] and [[Nakhon Ratchasima|Korat]].

===Location===
Khon Kaen is a city in the northeastern region of Thailand. The city is bisected by Mithraphap Road, also known as the "Friendship Highway", or "Highway 2", the road linking [[Bangkok]] to the [[Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge]]. Highway 230, a modern, multi-lane by-pass enables through-traffic to avoid the city center to the west, and connects to the airport, the new main bus station (BKS3).<ref>{{Cite news |date=2017-12-26 |title=Khon Kaen City's central bus terminal shuts down after 44 years |work=The Isaan Record |url=http://isaanrecord.com/2017/12/26/khon-kaen-citys-central-bus-terminal-shuts-44-years/ |access-date=27 December 2017}}</ref>

===Smart City ===
The province of Khon Kaen's 2017 population was 1.8 million with a [[GDP]] of 190 billion [[Thai baht|baht]].<ref name="BP-20181014" /> Its [[Smart City]] development plan aims to double its GDP per person to 394,000-493,000 baht by 2029 from an average of about 192,000 baht in 2016. Khon Kaen's plan has been incorporated into Thailand's 12th national social and economic plan (2017–2021). The plan has been driven largely by the Khon Kaen Think Tank (KKTT), a group of involved citizens. The Smart City's signature project is the Khon Kaen Transit System Co (KKTS), founded in 2017. Its plans for a 26 km [[Khon Kaen Light Rail Transit|light rail network]] from Samran to Tha Phra in the [[Mueang Khon Kaen District]] are complete and awaiting Thai Cabinet approval before bidding on the project can begin. The light rail system will feature 18 to 21 stations, take two years to complete, and will cost 15 billion baht. The Land Traffic Management Commission (LTMC), a national think tank for transportation policy, has already blessed the plan.<ref name="BP-20181014">{{Cite news |last1=Natanri |first1=Chakkrapan |last2=Kongrut |first2=Anchalee |date=14 October 2018 |title=Khon Kaen takes lead in Thailand's race to smarten up |work=Bangkok Post |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1557742/khon-kaen-takes-lead-in-thailands-race-to-smarten-up |access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref>

==Culture==
Thailand's 2014 EU Film Festival included Khon Kaen, together with [[Chiang Mai]] and [[Bangkok]], as host locations. A selection of six films were shown in the city, including the Spanish film ''[[Winning Streak (film)|The Pelayos]]'', and the Polish film ''Walesa, Man of Hope''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 May 2014 |title=Showtimes EU Film Festival 2014 |url=http://www.sfcinemacity.com/index.php/en/promotion-detail/Showtimes-EU-Film-Festival-2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525200219/http://www.sfcinemacity.com/index.php/en/promotion-detail/Showtimes-EU-Film-Festival-2014 |archive-date=25 May 2014 |access-date=24 May 2014 |website=SFX Cinemas |publisher=SFX Cinemas}}</ref>

==Administration==
The municipality of Khon Kaen was established on 20 August 1935, with an area of 4 square kilometers. It was later upgraded to a city municipality on 24 September 1995.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=24 September 1995 |title=พระราชกฤษฎีกา จัดตั้งเทศบาลนครขอนแก่น จังหวัดขอนแก่น พุทธศักราช ๒๔๗๘ |trans-title=Royal Decree of Khon Kaen City Municipality, Khon Kaen Province, Buddhist Era 2538 (1995) |url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2538/A/040/24.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917092803/http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2538/A/040/24.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 17, 2011 |journal=Royal Thai Government Gazette |volume=112 |issue=40 Kor |pages=24–28 |access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref> The administration of the city is now responsible for an area that covers approximately 46 sq. km. and consists of 66,179 households. There are 95 communities divided into 4 zones, each with about 20-30 communities each.

==Climate==
Khon Kaen's climate is categorized as [[tropical savanna climate|tropical savanna]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw''), with winters that are dry and very warm. Temperatures rise until April, a very hot month, with an average daily maximum of {{convert|36.3|°C|°F}}. The [[monsoon]] season runs from May until October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm.
