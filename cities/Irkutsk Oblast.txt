'''Irkutsk Oblast''' ({{langx|ru|Ирку́тская о́бласть|Irkutskaya oblastʹ}}; {{langx|bua|Эрхүү можо|Erkhüü mojo}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]), located in southeastern [[Siberia]] in the basins of the [[Angara River|Angara]], [[Lena River|Lena]], and [[Nizhnyaya Tunguska River]]s. The [[administrative center]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Irkutsk]]. It borders the [[Republic of Buryatia]] and the [[Tuva Republic]] in the south and southwest, which separate it from [[Khövsgöl Province]] in [[Mongolia]]; [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]] in the west; the [[Sakha Republic]] in the northeast; and [[Zabaykalsky Krai]] in the east. It had a population of 2,370,102 at the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Census]].<ref name=2021census> </ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Bgisu P5200477 ss.jpg|thumb|left|Spring time at the [[Botanic Garden of the Irkutsk State University|Irkutsk Botanic Garden]]. The pink blooming bushes in the middle are a relic plant, ''[[Prunus pedunculata]]''. ''[[Picea pungens]]'' trees are seen in the backdrop.]]

Irkutsk Oblast borders with the [[Republic of Buryatia]] and the [[Tuva Republic]] in the south and southwest, with [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]] in the west, with the [[Sakha Republic]] in the northeast, and with [[Zabaykalsky Krai]] in the east.

The unique and world-famous [[Lake Baikal]] is located in the southeast of the region.  It is drained by the [[Angara River|Angara]], which flows north across the province; the outflow rate is controlled by the [[Irkutsk Dam]]. The two other major dams on the Irkutsk Oblast's section of the Angara are [[Bratsk Dam|at Bratsk]] and [[Ust-Ilimsk Dam|Ust-Ilimsk]]; both forming large reservoirs. The [[Lena River|Lena]] has its source in Irkutsk Oblast as well, and flows north-east into the neighboring Sakha Republic.

Irkutsk Oblast consists mostly of the hills and broad valleys of the [[Central Siberian Plateau]], with the [[Lena-Angara Plateau]]. The [[Primorsky Range]] and the [[Baikal Mountains]] stretch along Lake Baikal, and in the northeast rise the [[North Baikal Highlands]] and the [[Patom Plateau]]. [[Pik Tofalariya]] is the highest point of the oblast.

===Climate===
The climate varies from warm summer [[Continental climate|continental]] in the south to continental-subarctic in the northern part ([[Köppen climate classification#Group D: Continental/microthermal climates|Köppen climate classification]]: ''Dwc'').

===Pre-history===
Mongolic-related [[Slab Grave Culture|Slab Grave]] cultural monuments survive in [[Lake Baikal|Baikal]] territory.<ref>History of Mongolia, Volume I, 2003</ref>{{qn|date=January 2019}} The territory of [[Buryatia]] came under the control of the [[Xiongnu]] Empire (209 BC – 93 CE), of the Mongolian [[Xianbei state]] (93–234), of the [[Rouran Khaganate]] (330–555), of the [[Göktürk Khaganate]] (555-603), of the [[Eastern Turkic Khaganate]] (603-744), of the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] (744-847), of the [[Yenisei Kyrgyz]] (847-1219), of the [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1368) and of the [[Northern Yuan]] (1368–1691).<ref name="HM">History of Mongolia, Volume II, 2003</ref> 
Medieval Mongol tribes like the [[Merkit]], [[Bayads]], [[Barga Mongols]] and [[Tümed]]s inhabited Buryatia.<ref name="HM"/> Today [[Buryats|Buryat-Mongols]] remain in the territory of the oblast.

[[Russian conquest of Siberia|Russian presence]] in the area dates from the 17th century: the [[Russian Tsardom]] expanded eastward following the [[conquest of the Khanate of Sibir]] in 1582. By the end of the 17th century, Irkutsk had become a small town, monasteries were being built, and suburbs and agricultural settlements had started to form.
===18th century===
From the 18th century trades and crafts began to develop, and gold- and silver-smiths appeared. As the Russian state expanded to the east of Irkutsk, the city became the capital of enormous territories from the [[Yenisey River]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], and played an important role in the exploration and securing of vast Eastern-Siberian and Far-Eastern territories for Russia. Gradually, Irkutsk gained more importance as the main transportation- and trade-center of Eastern Siberia; it became a center of trade routes from [[Kamchatka]], [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]], [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]] to [[Mongolia]], and [[China]]. The administrative importance of the city also increased, and it became a center of a fifth of the [[Governorate (Russia)|province]]s of Siberia; in 1764 it became the center of an independent province, the [[Irkutsk Governorate]].

For Irkutsk the 18th century was a time of research expeditions. Some of the organization of [[Vitus Bering]]'s [[First Kamchatka expedition|first]] (1725–1730) and [[Great Northern Expedition|second]] (1733-1743) expeditions to the shores of Kamchatka took place in Irkutsk.

A merchant class developed in the city of Irkutsk. In the second half of the eighteenth century, the Irkutsk industrial and merchant companies of [[Shelikhov-Golikov Company|Golikov]], Trapeznikov, {{ill|Ivan Stepanovich Bechevin|ru|Бечевин, Иван Степанович}}, {{ill|Nikolai Prokofevich Mylnikov|ru|Мыльников, Николай Прокофьевич}}, {{ill|Sibirakovy|ru|Сибиряковы}} began to explore the [[Aleutian Islands]] and later [[Alaska]]. In 1799 the merchant companies came together in a [[Russian-American Company]] "for the trades on the territory of the Aleutian and [[Kuril islands]] and the rest of the [[Bering Sea|North-Eastern sea]], belonging to Russia by the right of discovery". [[Grigorii Ivanovich Shelikhov]], an outstanding seafarer, played an important role in controlling enormous spaces of the northern part of the Pacific Ocean. He founded the first colonies of [[Russian America]] through the [[Shelikhov-Golikov Company]]. In 1727 the Russian Orthodox Church established the Irkutsk [[Eparchies and Metropolitanates of the Russian Orthodox Church|Eparchy]].

During the 18th century, schools, professional-technical education colleges, science museums, libraries, theaters, and book-printers developed in Irkutsk. Educational and cultural organizations opened. In 1725 the first school in Eastern Siberia, attached to the {{ill|Voznesensky monastery|ru|Вознесенский монастырь (Иркутск)}} (founded in 1672), opened, and in 1754 sea (navigation) schools and secondary schools opened throughout the Irkutsk area. The 1780s saw the opening of the second public library in provincial towns in Russia, as well as a regional museum and an amateur theater. In Irkutsk outstanding citizens appeared, still remembered today. These included the architect, geographer and historian {{ill|Anton ivanovich Losev|ru|Лосев, Антон Иванович}} (1765–1829), the writer {{ill|Ivan Timofeevich Kalashnikov|ru|Калашников, Иван Тимофеевич}} (1797–1863), and the teacher Semyon Semyonovich Schukin (1789—1863). Siberian science buildings opened. A.G. Laxman, [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov's]] apprentice, one of the first Siberian mineralogists, worked in Irkutsk.

The city landscape of Irkutsk was changing. The {{ill|Irkutsk Spassky church|ru|Спасская церковь (Иркутск)}} of 1706 (one of the oldest stone buildings in Eastern Siberia), the unique {{ill|Irkutsk Krestovozdvizhenskaya church|ru|Крестовоздвиженская церковь (Иркутск)}} (1747), the "[[Prikaz]]naya izba" (order house), the first stone construction, and the Triumph gate were built.
===19th century===
[[File:Ferroviacircolarebaikal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Circum-Baikal Railway]] skirts the southwestern tip of Lake Baikal]]
In the late eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century, Irkutsk Province gradually increased in importance as a center of trade, craft, and culture. It became the center of Russian trade with China and, from the 1830s, a gold-manufacturing center of Eastern Siberia. In 1803 Irkutsk became the center of the Siberian [[Governorate-General (Russian Empire)|Governorate-General]], and in 1822 it became the center of the [[East-Siberian Governorate-General|Eastern Siberian Governorate-General]]. The Governors-General of Eastern Siberia greatly influenced the development of the city.

Irkutsk merchants explored the [[Yeniseysk Governorate|Yeniseysky]] and [[Vitim River|Leno-Vitimsky]] gold regions and substantially increased their capital, which made them the richest merchants in Siberia. The Irkutsk merchant class began to play a major role in the city's development. Intensive city construction took place. Private residences, hospitals, orphanages, and schools were built, while significant funds went towards education and the development of science in the region.

The architecture of the city of Irkutsk underwent change. The {{ill|Irkutsk White House|ru|Белый дом (Иркутск)}}, done in Russian classic style in 1800–1804, and the {{ill|Moscow Triumphal Gates of Irkutsk|ru|Московские ворота (Иркутск)}} – a monument of the nineteenth century, were built in honor of the tenth anniversary of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I's]] reign.

In the second half of the nineteenth century the printing art developed in Irkutsk, the first newspapers being, “Irkutsk province news” and “Amur”. The names of A.P.Schapov, M.B.Zagoskin, V.I.Vagin were connected with the newspaper “Siberia”. In 1851, the first scientific organization in Eastern Siberia – the Siberian branch of Russian geographical society, was opened. In 1877, it was called the Eastern-Siberian branch. V.I.Dybovskii, A.L.Chekanovskii, I.D.Cherskii, V.A.Obruchev, geologists, geographers and researchers of Siberia, worked in Irkutsk Oblast on exploring [[Lake Baikal]] and the [[Lena River]].

The summer of 1879 could be considered to be a dramatic period in the city of Irkutsk's history. During a July 22–24 fire almost all the central parts of the city were burnt, and more than two thirds of city buildings and 75 city districts were destroyed. The city began to revive, getting a new look. Stone and wooden constructions built after the fire have been preserved up to the present day. In 1898 the arrival of the first train via the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to Irkutsk Oblast was a major event. The construction of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] contributed to further city development.

Several politically exiled figures were connected with Irkutsk city. Among the first of the exiled was A.N. Radischev, who lived in Irkutsk for more than 3 months. Since the 1830s, the Decembrists lived in settlements and in colonies in the Irkutsk Oblast. The exiled houses of Volkonsky and Trubetskoy later became house-museums. N. A. Panov, I. V. Podzhio, A. Z. Muravyov, P. A. Mukhanov, A. P. Yushnevsky, V. A. Bechasnov, the wife of Trubetskoy and their children stayed in Irkutsk for the rest of their lives. In the late 1850s, the Petrashevtzy appeared in Irkutsk. The exiled historian-democrat, A.P. Schapov, lived here until his last days, and the Polish rebels and revolutionaries (including the ''narodnik'') also lived here.

[[File:Иркутск. Часовня Спасителя и Медведниковский Банк, ф.1897г..JPG|thumb|right|Chapel of the Savior and Medvednikovsky Bank, 1897]]
A well-known Russian publicist of the nineteenth century, N. Shelgunov, wrote about Irkutsk: “Irkutsk is the only Siberian city, which has the city character. ...As England created London, France - Paris, Siberia – created Irkutsk. Siberia is proud of Irkutsk, “not to see this city” means “not to see Siberia”.

In the early nineteenth century the city was considerably changed, especially its center. Large buildings were being built, mason streets were being made, cab drivers and street lights appeared. The water supply and the first electrification stations were built. The Irkutsk Regional museum was stamped with the names of Siberian researchers on its walls (1883), the building of the first public community, city theater (1897), Kazan' cathedral, made in new Byzantine style (1893), and the Roman Catholic cathedral (1895) completed an architectural style of the city. In 1908 a monument to [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] was opened on the Angara embankment.

[[File:ИрГСХА.JPG|thumb|right|The orphanage of E. Medvednikova is the first women's educational institution in Siberia. Irkutsk, Timiryazeva street, 59]]
The city was damaged and influenced by the political events of the twentieth century – the Russian revolution, the 1917 [[October Revolution]], the Civil war and the [[Great Patriotic War]] (as the Soviet Union's part in WW2 is commonly referred to in Russia. This is distinct from WW2, in that it began with 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa]], whereas WW2 began with the September 1939 [[invasion of Poland]]).

Since the 1930s the industrial construction of the city had begun. Mechanical engineering plants, the air plant, brick and concrete plants, tea fabric, and food industry plants were being built. Economic development of the city contributed to scientific, educational and cultural development. The first Higher education in Eastern Siberia, [[Irkutsk State University]] was founded in 1918. Its departments were developing as independent institutes: medical, pedagogical, finance-economical. In 1930 the metallurgic institute was opened, in 1934 the agricultural institute was organized.

The early Soviets educated women in traditional professions like nursing and primary education. At right is the Irkutsk orphanage named for E. Medvednikova, which served both as an eleemosynary institution and educational facility.

Since the 1950s a rapid development of the city of Irkutsk took place. In 1947 streetcar routes were opened in the city and trolleybus routes were opened in 1972. In 1958 a TV center was established. The city's larger districts and micro regions construction period began. New districts such as Baykalsky, Solnechny, Yubileyny, Primorsky, Akademgorodok and others were created.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manus.baikal.ru/eng/essay.htm|title=Essay about Irkutsk|access-date=December 5, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222053/http://www.manus.baikal.ru/eng/essay.htm|archive-date=March 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

One small ethnic group, concentrated in three villages (Pikhtinsk, Sredne-Pikhtinsk, and Dagnik) in [[Zalarinsky District]] is the so-called "Bug Hollanders": descendants of Polish-speaking [[Lutheran]] farmers who had moved to Siberia from the then Russian [[Volhynia]] in 1911–1912 in search of affordable land.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Although they had long lost German (or Dutch) language of their ancestors (even in the early twentieth century they spoke Ukrainian and read Polish), they were still considered [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|ethnic Germans]], and during [[World War II]] were usually drafted for work in labor camps, instead of front-line military service.<ref>Olga Solovyova (Ольга Соловьева) [http://www.strana-oz.ru/?numid=27&article=1189 "Bug 'Hollanders'" (БУЖСКИЕ ГОЛЕНДРЫ)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003527/http://www.strana-oz.ru/?numid=27&article=1189 |date=September 27, 2007 }} {{in lang|ru}}</ref>

Irkutsk Oblast registered natural population growth in 2008, the first time after 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.irtel.ru/soc.php |title=Иркутскстат |access-date=2008-11-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303180717/http://www.stat.irtel.ru/soc.php |archive-date=March 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Still, the future prospects for population growth in Irkutsk seems bleak. In 2007, women in Irkutsk were having an average of 1.602 children each. Fertility rate was extremely low in urban areas, where women were having just 1.477 children each. In rural areas however, the fertility rate was slightly above replaceable levels. In rural areas of Irkutsk Oblast, women were having an average of 2.165 children each. (Figures are not available for 2008, although for Russia as a whole fertility rates for 2008 were approx. 6% higher than that in 2007, and for Irkutsk 9% higher).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gks.ru/doc_2008/family.zip |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-12-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723095742/http://www.gks.ru/doc_2008/family.zip |archive-date=July 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
