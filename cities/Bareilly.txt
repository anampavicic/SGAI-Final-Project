'''Bareilly''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Bareilly.ogg|b|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|l|i}}) is a city in [[Bareilly district]] in the [[Indian state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. It is among the largest metropolises in [[Western Uttar Pradesh]] and is the centre of the [[Bareilly division]] as well as the historical region of [[Rohilkhand]]. The city lies in the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]s, about {{convert|252|km|mi|0}} northwest of the state capital, [[Lucknow]], and {{convert|265|km|mi|0}} east of the national capital, [[New Delhi]]. With a population of 903,668 in 2011, it is the [[List of cities in Uttar Pradesh by population|eighth most populous city]] in the state, [[list of North Indian cities by population|17th]] in [[northern India]] and [[List of most populous cities in India|54th]] in India.<ref name="censusindia.gov.in">{{Cite web |url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/0919_PART_B_DCHB_BAREILLY.pdf |title=District Census Handbook - Pune - Part XII-B |access-date=21 April 2017 |website=Census of India |date=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114012959/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/0919_PART_B_DCHB_BAREILLY.pdf |archive-date=14 November 2015 }}</ref> It is located on the bank of [[Ramganga]] River and is the site of the Ramganga Barrage built for canal irrigation.

The earliest settlement in what is now Bareilly was established in 1537 by a local chieftain Jagat Singh Katehriya who named it 'Bans-Bareli' after his two sons Bansaldev and Bareldev. The town came under the rule of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in 1569 and had become the capital of a local [[pargana]] by 1596. The foundation of the modern city of Bareilly was laid by Mughal governor [[Mukrand Rai]] in 1657, and in 1658 it became the seat of the governor of [[Budaun]]. The weakening of Mughal Empire lead to the rise of the [[Kingdom of Rohilkhand]], of which Bareilly was a major centre. The city came under the control of [[Oudh State]] in 1774 after the fall of Rohillas in the [[First Rohilla War]] and was then ceded to the [[British East India Company]] by the [[Nawab of Oudh]] in 1801. A [[Bareilly Cantonment|Military station]] was established in 1811 to the south of the city, where a fort was constructed in 1816. Bareilly was freed by the rebels during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and remained independent under the rule of [[Khan Bahadur Khan Rohilla|Khan Bahadur Khan]] until it was re-annexed by the British in 1858.

Bareilly is renowned for being the place of origin of the [[Barelvi Movement]], a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Islamic movement formed by notable scholar Imam [[Ahmed Raza Khan]] Qadri to counter the growing influence of [[Wahabism]]. His shrine, located at the [[Bareilly Sharif Dargah]], is visited by millions every year on the occasion of [[Urs-e-Razavi]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Agarwal |first1=Priyangi |title=Urs-e-Razvi audio live-streamed on social media |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/urs-e-razvi-audio-live-streamed-on-social-media/articleshow/66516570.cms |access-date=18 February 2022 |work=The Times of India |date=6 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livehindustan.com/uttarakhand/rudrapur/story-urs-pak-will-be-celebrated-in-bareilly-from-today-to-march-3-3881347.html|title = आज से तीन मार्च तक बरेली में मनाया जाएगा उर्से पाक }}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Bareilly}}
[[File:Ahichchhatra_Fort_Temple_Bareilly.jpg|400px|thumb|left|alt=Multi-coloured political map|[[Ahichchhatra]] (or Ahi-Kshetra) was the ancient capital of Northern Panchala. The remains of this city have been discovered in Bareilly]]
According to the epic [[Mahābhārata]], the Bareilly region ([[Panchala]]) is said to be the birthplace of [[Draupadi]], who was also referred to as 'Panchali' (one from the kingdom of Panchāla) by Kṛṣṇā ([[Krishna|Lord Krishna]]). When [[Yudhishthira]] becomes the king of [[Hastinapur]] at the end of the [[Mahābhārata]], Draupadi becomes his queen. The folklore says that [[Gautama Buddha]] had once visited the ancient fortress city of [[Ahichchhatra]] in Bareilly.<ref name="members.rediff.com">{{cite web|url=http://members.rediff.com/gangwar/Bareilly.html |title=About Bareilly |access-date=8 November 2010 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714233142/http://members.rediff.com/gangwar/Bareilly.html |archive-date=14 July 2007 }}</ref> The [[Jain]] [[Tirthankara]] [[Parshva]] is said to have attained Kaivalya at Ahichchhatra.<ref name="bareilly.nic.in">{{Cite web|url=http://bareilly.nic.in/hist.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826065926/http://bareilly.nic.in/hist.htm|url-status=dead|title=history<!-- Bot generated title -->|archive-date=26 August 2010}}</ref>

In the 12th century, the kingdom was under the rule by different clans of [[Kshatriya]] Rajputs. Then the region became part of the [[Muslim]] [[Turkic people|Turkic]] [[Delhi Sultanate]] for '''325''' years before getting absorbed in the emerging [[Mughal Empire]].  The foundation of the modern City of Bareilly foundation was laid by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] governor [[Mukrand Rai]] in 1657 during the rule of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]]. Later the region became the capital of [[Rohilkhand]] region before getting handed over to [[Nawab]] [[Vizier|Vazir]] of [[Awadh]] and then to [[East India Company]] (transferred to the British India) and later becoming an integral part of [[Republic of India|India]]. The region has, also, acted as a mint for a major part of its history.

From archaeological point of view the district of Bareilly is very rich. The extensive remains of Ahichchhatra, the Capital town of Northern Panchala have been discovered near [[Ramnagar, Bareilly|Ramnagar village]] of Aonla Tehsil in the district. It was during the first excavations at Ahichchhatra (1940–44) that the painted grey ware, associated with the advent of the Aryans in the Ganges–Yamuna Valley, was recognised for the first time in the earliest levels of the site.  Nearly five thousand coins belonging to periods earlier than that of Guptas have been yielded from Ahichchhatra. It has also been one of the richest sites in India from the point of view of the total yield of terracotta. Some of the masterpieces of Indian terracotta art are from Ahichchhatra. In fact the classification made of the terracotta human figurines from Ahichchhatra on grounds of style and to some extent stratigraphy became a model for determining the stratigraphy of subsequent excavations at other sites in the Ganges Valley. On the basis of the existing material, the archaeology of the region helps us to get an idea of the cultural sequence from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC up to the 11th century AD. Some ancient mounds in the district have also been discovered by the Deptt. of Ancient History and culture, [[Rohilkhand University]], at Tihar-Khera (Fatehganj West), Pachaumi, Rahtuia, Kadarganj and [[Sainthal, Uttar Pradesh|Sainthal]].<ref name="bareilly.nic.in" /> Apart from this, artefacts of painted grey ware culture of the Iron Age have also been discovered near the city.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/artefacts-of-painted-grey-ware-culture-found-in-bareilly-village/articleshow/69549550.cms|title=Artefacts of painted grey ware culture found in Bareilly village &#124; Bareilly News - Times of India|website=The Times of India|date=29 May 2019 }}</ref>

===British East India Company===
Under Barech at the 1761 [[Third Battle of Panipat]], Rohilkhand blocked the expansion of the [[Maratha]] Empire into northern India. In 1772 it was invaded by the Marathas, repulsing the invasion with the aid of the [[Nawab of Awadh]]. After the war, Nawab [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] demanded payment for the nawabs' help from Barech. When his demand was refused, the nawab joined the East India Company (under [[Governor-General of India|Governor]] [[Warren Hastings]] and his [[Commander-in-Chief]], [[Alexander Champion (East India Company officer)|Alexander Champion]]) to invade Rohilkhand. The combined forces of Daula and the Company defeated Barech (who was killed in battle at [[Miranpur, Uttar Pradesh|Miranpur Katra]], ending Rohilla rule) in 1774. Rohilkhand was handed over to Daula, and from 1774 to 1800 the province was ruled by the Nawab of Awadh who surrendered Rohilkhand to the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]] in a treaty signed on 10 November 1801.

After the [[Rohilla War]], the change in the power structure increased discontent throughout the district.

The most popular trades in and around Bareilly during the 1820s were manufacturing glass, jewellery, glass and [[Lac (resin)|lac]] bangles and gold and silver thread, crimping, bean drying, wire drawing, [[Manjaa|charpoy]] weaving, keeping a grocer's shop and selling kebabs.<ref name="library.upenn.edu" />

====Rebellion of 1857 {{anchor|Indian Rebellion of 1857}}====
Bareilly was a centre of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. The rebellion began as a [[mutiny]] of Indian soldiers ([[sepoy]]s), employed in the three [[Presidency armies]], against race- and religion-based injustices and inequities on 10 May 1857 in [[Meerut]]. It expanded into other mutinies and civilian rebellions, primarily in the major north-central Indian river valleys; local episodes extended northwest to [[Peshawar]] (on the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|northwest frontier]] with Afghanistan) and southeast (beyond Delhi). There were riots in many parts of Uttar Pradesh, and Muslims in Bareilly, [[Bijnor]] and [[Moradabad]] called for the revival of a Muslim kingdom.<ref>[[R. C.

On its east are [[Pilibhit]] and [[Shahjahanpur]], [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]] on the west, [[Udham Singh Nagar]] ([[Uttarakhand]]) to the north and [[Badaun]] to the south. The city is level and well-watered, sloping towards the south. Its soil is fertile, with groves of trees. A rain forest in the north, known as the ''tarai'', contains tigers, bears, deer and wild pigs. The river Sarda (or Gogra) forms the eastern boundary and is the principal waterway.<ref name=EB1911/> The Ramganga receives most of the drainage from the Kumaon mountains, and the Deoha also receives many small streams. The [[Gomti River|Gomati]] (or Gumti) is also nearby.<ref name=EB1911/>

=== Civic administration ===
The municipal board of Bareilly was established on 24 June 1858 under the North-West Provinces and Oudh Act XXVI of 1850. It was then a municipal committee, which was constituted by nominated members headed by the District Magistrate, who was its Ex-Officio Chairman. Seven of the nine nominated members were British including the Magistrate. Later, the North-West Provinces and Oudh Municipal Improvements Act of 1868 (Act VI of '68) recommended the elective principle, which was duly implemented. However, the District Magistrate still remained the chairman of this committee. The Members continued to be nominated by the government until the year 1868, when the elective principle was partially adopted - 27 members now came through election process, while 9 members were still nominated by the government. This system continued until 1900 when, under the Act of 1900, the number of nominated members was changed to 6 and the number of elected members became 18. Nominated members were reduced to 3 by the Municipality Act of 1916 while the number of elected members was increased to 19. Major changes were introduced in 1963; All members of the 48-member committee were now elected, and the system of nomination was abolished. The term of the board was usually 6 years.{{sfn|Mohammad|1986}}

==Economy==
[[File:Factories in Parsakhera Bareilly.jpg|thumb|B.L. Agro Refinery at Parsakhera. The Parsakhera Industrial Estate was established by [[UP State Industrial Development Corporation|UPSIDC]] in 1980.]]
Since India began liberalising its economy, Bareilly has experienced rapid growth. Commerce has diversified with mall culture, although the area's rural economy remains agrarian, handicraft (zari-zardosi embroidery work on cloth material), bamboo and cane furniture. The city is equidistant from [[New Delhi]] (national capital) and [[Lucknow]], the capital of Uttar Pradesh. This makes Bareilly a nodal point between two major cities of India.

Bareilly was a flourishing cotton centre in early nineteenth century. There were about 20,000 looms in the city in 1802, with a production value of Rs 30,00,000 per year.<ref name="Gommans">{{cite book |last1=Gommans |first1=Jos J.

Now, Bareilly Junction lies on Lucknow-Moradabad Line and Lucknow-Sitapur-Lakhimpur-Pilibhit-Bareilly-Kasganj Line. Bareilly has been Connected to the rest of India by rail since the 19th century, and a 1909 map shows that Bareilly was a railway junction during the early 20th century. Six rail lines intersect in the city. After the British Indian Government purchased the Indian Branch Railway on 31 March 1872, and renamed the [[Lucknow–Kanpur Suburban Railway|Lucknow–Kanpur main line]] as the [[Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway]], railway services started to expand towards the west of Lucknow. The construction of a railway line from Lucknow to [[Sandila]] and then further onwards to [[Hardoi]] was completed in 1872.<ref name=orr>{{cite web | url = http://management.ebooks6.com/The-Oudh-Rohilkhand-Railway-download-w23852.pdf | title = The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway | publisher = Management E-books6 | access-date = 30 May 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This line was further extended to Bareilly on 1 November 1873.<ref name=orr /> Prior to that, another railway line connecting [[Moradabad]] to [[Chandausi]] had already been built in 1872; it too was extended to Bareilly, the construction completed on 22 December 1873.<ref name=orr />

A new railway line connecting Bareilly and Moradabad via [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]], called the Bareilly–Moradabad Chord, was approved on 4 December 1891, and was completed by 8 June 1894.<ref name=orr /> On 8 December 1894, the main line was officially diverted to this chord, while the older line was renamed the Chandausi loop.<ref name=orr /> In 1890 the Bengal and North Western Railway leased the Tirhoot State Railway to increase the latter's revenue, and the Lucknow-Sitapur-Seramow Provincial State Railway merged with the Bareilly-Pilibheet Provincial State Railway to form the Lucknow-Bareilly Railway on 1 January 1891. The Lucknow-Bareilly Railway was owned by the Government of India, and operated by the Rohilkund and Kumaon Railway.

The Oudh and Tirhut Railway was formed on 1 January 1943 by the merger of the Bengal and North Western Railway, the Tirhut Railway (BNW operated), the Mashrak-Thawe Extension Railway (BNW operated), the Rohilkund and Kumaon Railway and the Lucknow-Bareilly Railway (R&K operated). The Oudh and Tirhut Railway was later renamed the Oudh Tirhut Railway; it merged with the Assam Railway and the Kanpur-Achnera section of the [[Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway]] to form [[North Eastern Railway (India)|North Eastern Railway]] (headquartered in [[Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh|Gorakhpur]], with a divisional headquarters in [[Izzatnagar]]), one of the 16 zones of the [[Indian Railways]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rao|1988|pp=42–3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://indianrailwaynotes.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/north-eastern-railway.pdf |title=Northeastern Railway |access-date=11 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106101710/http://indianrailwaynotes.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/north-eastern-railway.pdf |archive-date=6 November 2013 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rao|1988|p=37}}</ref><ref name=r>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/financecode/ADMIN_FINANCE/AdminFinanceCh1_Data.htm |title=Chapter 1 – Evolution of Indian Railways-Historical Background |publisher=Ministry of Railways website |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601024404/http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/financecode/ADMIN_FINANCE/AdminFinanceCh1_Data.htm |archive-date=1 June 2009 }}</ref>
