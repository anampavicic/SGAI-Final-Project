'''Yoshkar-Ola''' ([[Mari language|Mari]] and {{langx|ru|Йошкар-Ола}}) is the [[capital city]] of [[Mari El]], [[Russia]]. Yoshkar-Ola means “red city” in [[Meadow Mari language|Mari]] and was formerly known as '''Tsarevokokshaysk''' ({{lang|ru|Царевококшайск}}) before 1919, as '''Krasnokokshaysk''' ({{lang|ru|Краснококшайск}}) between 1919 and 1927 both after the [[Malaya Kokshaga River]] and '''Charla''' ({{lang|mhr|Чарла}}), by the Mari people.

Yoshkar-Ola was established as a military fortress in 1584, following the Russian conquest of the Mari-inhabited regions of the [[Volga]] and its tributaries. It is one of the centers of the [[Mari people]] (especially of the Meadow Mari subgroup) and the administrative center of the Yoshkar-Ola city district.

Yoshkar-Ola was established as a military fortress in 1584, following the Russian conquest of the [[Mari El|Mari region]].
Yoshkar-Ola means “red city” in [[Meadow Mari language|Mari]] and before 1919 was known as Tsaryovokokshaysk ({{lang|ru|Царевококшайск}}), between 1919 and 1927 also as Krasnokokshaysk ({{lang|ru|Краснококшайск}})  both after the [[Malaya Kokshaga River]] and is known as Charla ({{lang|mhr|Чарла}}) amongst the Mari people.

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, especially after [[World War II]], the city was a regional industrial and transport center and grew to its current size.

The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] removed support for [[state enterprise]]s, and led to the shutdown of most manufacturing activity in the area.  Much of the city's economic activity was supported by [[shuttle trading|shuttle traders]] who would transport (often [[counterfeit]]) goods from the bustling markets of [[Moscow]] to Yoshkar-Ola's [[bazaar]]s. The sharp decline in living standards led to the emigration of specialized professionals to larger cities in Russia.{{when|date=September 2022}}
