Ardabil is known for its trade in [[silk]] and [[carpet]]s. [[Ardabil rugs]] are renowned and the ancient [[Ardabil Carpet|Ardabil carpets]] are considered among the best of classical [[Persian carpet]]s. Ardabil is also home to a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]], [[Sheikh Safi al-Din Khānegāh and Shrine Ensemble]], the sanctuary and tomb of [[Sheikh|Shaikh]] [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili|Safî ad-Dîn]], and the tomb of [[Ismail I]], founder of the [[Safavid Iran|Safavid Empire]].

== Etymology ==
The name Ardabil comes from the [[Avestan]] ''artavil'' or ''artawila'' which means "holy place".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Place Names|last=Everett-Heath|first=John|title=Ardabīl|year=2020|edition=6|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-190563-6 |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191905636.001.0001/acref-9780191905636-e-10573?rskey=K9pVJS&result=2}}</ref> 

==History==
[[File:Ardebil int coninckryck van Persien - Peeters Jacob - 1690.jpg|thumb|Ardabil in 1690]]
[[File:Portrait of Shah Ismail I. Inscribed "Ismael Sophy Rex Pers". Painted by Cristofano dell'Altissimo, dated 1552-1568.jpg|thumb|[[Shah Ismail|Ismail I]], the founder of [[Safavid Iran|Safavid Empire]].]]
The pre-Islamic history of Ardabil is vague.{{sfn|Bosworth|1986|pp=357–365}} Muslim historians attribute the foundation of Ardabil to the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] [[King of Kings]] [[Peroz I]] ({{reign|459|484}}), who named it Shad Peroz or Shahram Peroz.{{sfn|Badiyi|2020|p=214}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1986|pp=357–365}} The city may have corresponded to the Sasanian mint city known in [[Middle Persian]] as ATRA, albeit this remains uncertain. During the [[Arab conquest of Iran]], Ardabil was the seat of a ''[[marzban]]'' ([[margrave]]), who agreed to surrender to the Arabs in return for permitting the people of Ardabil to continue their religious observances at the [[fire temple]] of Shiz (present-day [[Takht-e Soleymān|Takht-e Solayman]]).{{sfn|Bosworth|1986|pp=357–365}} 

Due to being near the [[Caucasus]], Ardabil was always susceptible to attacks by the Caucasian hill peoples as well as by the inhabitants of [[Ciscaucasia|the steppes of Northern Caucasus]]. In 730–731, the [[Khazars]] passed through the [[Darial Gorge|Alan Gates]], and defeated and killed the [[Arminiya|Arab governor of Armenia]], [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah]]. The clash took place on the plain outside the town of Ardabil, which was subsequently captured by the Khazars, who made incursions as far as [[Diyar Bakr]] and [[Al-Jazira (caliphal province)|al-Jazira]] before they were repelled by the Umayyad prince [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]] (d. 738).{{sfn|Bosworth|1986|pp=357–365}} According to the Arab geographer [[al-Maqdisi]] (d. 991), "seventy languages" were spoken around Ardabil, which most likely refers to various variations of the [[Old Azeri|Adhari language]].{{sfn|Crone|2012|p=46}}

In 1209, a reinvigorated [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]] had its forces plunder Ardabil, reportedly killing 12,000 residents. Ardabil later withstood two attacks by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], but was ultimately sacked by them in 1220. The city managed to recuperate and reached a more blossoming state than before, though by this time Tabriz was the leading city in the [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] region, and under the later [[Ilkhanate]], it had become [[Soltaniyeh]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1986|pp=357–365}}

Safavid king [[Ismail I]], born in Ardabil, started his campaign to nationalize Iran's government and land from there, but consequently announced Tabriz as his capital [[Siege of Tabriz (1501)|in 1501]]. Yet Ardabil remained an important city both politically and economically until modern times. During the frequent [[Ottoman-Persian Wars]], being close to the borders, it was often sacked by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] between 1514 and 1722 as well as in 1915 during [[World War I]] when the former invaded neighboring Iran.

In the early [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] period, crown prince [[Abbas Mirza]], son of then incumbent king ([[shah]]) [[Fath Ali Shah Qajar]] (r. 1797–1834) was the governor of Ardabil.{{sfn|Bosworth|1986|pp=357–365}} With Ardabil already once being sacked by the Russians during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–1813)|Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813]], and this being the era of the Russians steadily advancing into the Iranian possessions in the Caucasus, Abbas Mirza ordered the Napoleonic general [[Claude Matthieu, Count Gardane|Gardane]], who served the Qajars at the time, to strengthen and fortify the town with [[rampart (fortification)|rampart]]s. During the next and final war, the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Russo-Persian War of 1826–28]], the ramparts were stormed by the Russian troops, who then temporarily occupied the town.{{sfn|Bosworth|1986|pp=357–365}} The town's extensive and noted library, known as the library of [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili]], was taken to [[St. Petersburg]] by General [[Ivan Paskevich]] with the promise that its holdings would be brought to the Russian capital for safekeeping until they could be returned, a promise never fulfilled.{{sfn|Bosworth|1986|pp=357–365}}

After the [[Russo-Persian Wars]], Iran ceded its territories in the Caucasus to Russia under the terms of the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] (1828). As a result, Ardabil was situated only 40 kilometers from the newly drawn border, becoming even more important economically as a stop on a major caravan route along which European goods entered Iran from Russia.<ref name="iranicaonlineii">{{cite web|last1=Planhol|first1=X.|title=ARDABĪL. ii. Modern Ardabīl.|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ardabil|website=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=5 June 2016|date=1986}}</ref> After he visited Ardabil in 1872, German diplomat Max von Thielmann noted, in his book published in 1875, the extensive activity in the town's bazaar, as well as the presence of many foreigners,<ref name="iranicaonlineii"/> and estimated its population at 20,000.<ref name="iranicaonlineii"/> During the early [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]], Russia occupied Ardabil together with other Iranian cities until the eventual collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1917.{{sfn|Bosworth|1986|pp=357–365}}

===Geology===
The hot springs and natural landscapes in the Ardabil area attract tourists.{{fact|date=October 2020}} The mineral springs of Ardabil (Beele-Darreh, Sar'eyn, Sardabeh and Booshloo) are notable throughout Iran for their medicinal qualities.

Of the many lakes in the area, the largest include Ne'or, [[Shorabil]], ShoorGel, NouShahr and Aloocheh that are the habitats of some species of water birds. The Lake Ne'or is located in a mountainous area 48&nbsp;km south-east of the city of Ardabil. It covers an area of 2.1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and has an average depth of 3 metres. It is fed by springs in the lake bed.

===Earthquakes===
Ardabil is associated with historical confusion between the [[893 Dvin earthquake]] which was often wrongly documented as the [[893 Ardabil earthquake]] due to the similarity of the Arabic name for city of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] in [[Armenia]], 'Dabil' to Ardabil.

On 28 February 1997, a [[1997 Ardabil earthquake|destructive earthquake]] hit the Ardabil area.  At least 965 people were killed, 2,600 injured, 36,000 homeless, 12,000 houses damaged or destroyed and 160,000 livestock were killed. Severe damage was observed to roads, electrical power lines, communications and water distribution systems around Ardabil.<ref name = USGS>{{cite web |last=Person|first=Waverley L |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/eqarchives/significant/sig_1997.php |title=Significant Earthquakes of the World: 1997|access-date=2008-10-18 | publisher =[[United States Geological Survey]] |date=2008-07-16 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081004192030/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/eqarchives/significant/sig_1997.php| archive-date= 4 October 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Ardabil Airport.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Ardabil Airport]]]]
The economy of Ardabil is partially agricultural, partially tourist-based, with some industries in operation.

The Iranian government in 2006 announced plans to build "the largest textile factory of its kind in the Middle East" in Ardabil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/06/jan/1190.html|title=Huge textile factory, largest in Middle East to become operational in Ardebil|work=payvand.com|access-date=23 January 2006|archive-date=25 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525091726/http://www.payvand.com/news/06/jan/1190.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Arta Industrial Group]] (AIG) has one of the largest textile conglomerates in Iran, which is located in the provinces called [[Qazvin]] and Ardabil. The group has received numerous awards for being one of the top 20 exporters and industrial groups in Iran since 1998. It is the first company to produce [[hardboard|high-density fiberboard]] (HDF), [[medium-density fiberboard]] (MDF), [[laminate]] [[flooring]] and multi-layer films in Iran.

AIG has the first private industrial site in [[Iran]] in the city of Ardabil, which has fifteen main factories owned by (AIG). This Industrial zone covers an area of 100 hectares and Residential Area for engineers and managers of the company.

The city is served by [[Refah Chain Stores Co.]], [[Iran Hyper Star]], [[Isfahan City Center]], [[Shahrvand Chain Stores Inc.]], [[:fa:شرکت_فروشگاه‌های_زنجیره‌ای_افق_کوروش|Ofoq Kourosh chain store]].

===Bazaars===
{{main|Ardabil Bazaar}}
In the heart of the city, stands the ancient [[bazaar]], described by historians of the 4th century CE as cruciform, with simply designed domes extending in four directions. Most sections of the bazaar were constructed and renovated during the [[Safavid]] and [[Zand District|Zand]] periods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itto.org/tourismattractions/?sight=317#ixzz1dKP5laje|title=Ardabil Bazaar in Ardebil , [Iran Tourism & Touring Organization]|work=itto.org}}</ref>

==Shrine==
One of the main sights in the city of Ardabil in north-west Iran is the shrine of Shaykh Safi al-Din Ardabili, who died in 1334. The Shaykh was a [[Sufi]] leader, who trained his followers in Islamic mystic practices. After his death, his followers remained loyal to his family, who became increasingly powerful.

In 1501, one of his descendants, Shah Isma'il, seized political power. He united Iran for the first time in several centuries and established the Shi'i form of Islam as the state religion. Isma'il was the founder of the [[Safavid]] dynasty, named after Shaykh Safi al-Din.

The Safavids, who ruled without a break until 1722, and then intermittently until 1757, promoted the shrine of the Shaykh as a place of pilgrimage.

==Ardabil carpet==
[[File:Ardabil-glim.JPG|thumb|An Ardabil "qilim" ([[Ardabil rug]])]]
{{main|Ardabil Carpet}}
In the late 1530s, Isma'il's son, Shah Tahmasp, enlarged the shrine, and it was at this time, that the carpet was made as one of a matching pair. The completion of the carpets was marked by a four-line inscription placed at one end. The first two lines are a poetic quotation that refers to the shrine as a place of refuge:

'Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.
Except for this door there is no resting-place for my head.'

The third line is a signature, 'The work of the slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani.' Maqsud was probably the court official charged with producing the carpets. He was not necessarily a slave in the literal sense but called himself one to express humility, while the word for 'portal' can be used for a royal court or a shrine. Perhaps Maqsud meant both, as in this case the court was the patron of the shrine.

The fourth line contains the date 946 in the Muslim calendar, which is equivalent to 1539–1540 CE.

===The Ardabil Carpet and the V&A===
The two Ardabil carpets were still in the shrine of Shaykh Safi al-Din in 1843, when one was seen by two British visitors. Thirty years or more later, the shrine suffered an earthquake, and the carpets were sold off, perhaps to raise funds for repairs. The damaged carpets were purchased in Iran by [[Ziegler & Co.]], a Manchester firm involved in the carpet trade. Parts of one carpet were used to patch the other. The result was one 'complete' carpet and one with no border.

In 1892, the larger carpet was put on sale by Vincent Robinson & Co. of London. The designer [[William Morris]] went to inspect it on behalf of this museum. Reporting that the carpet was 'of singular perfection ... logically and consistently beautiful', he urged the museum to buy it. The money was raised, and in March 1893 the Museum acquired the carpet for £2000.

The second, smaller carpet was sold secretly to an American collector, and in 1953 it was given to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The Ardabil carpet hung on the wall in this gallery for many years. In 2006, the museum created the case in the centre of the gallery so that the carpet could be seen as intended, on the floor. To preserve its colours, it is lit for ten minutes on the hour and half-hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/h/History-of-the-ardabil-carpet/|title=History of the Ardabil Carpet|work=vam.ac.uk}}</ref>
