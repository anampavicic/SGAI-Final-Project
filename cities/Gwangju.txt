'''Gwangju'''{{efn|In the 19th century, Gwangju was also known in English sources as '''Tsien-tsiou'''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=390}}}} ({{Korean|hangul=광주}}; {{IPA|ko|kwaŋ.dʑu|lang|Ko-광주.oga}}), formerly romanized as Kwangju, is South Korea's [[list of cities in South Korea|sixth-largest metropolis]]. It is a designated [[Special cities of South Korea|metropolitan city]] under the direct control of the central government's Home Minister. The city was also the capital of [[South Jeolla Province]] [[Provinces of Korea|Province]] until the provincial office moved to the southern village of [[Namak, South Korea|Namak]] in [[Muan County]] in 2005 because Gwangju was promoted to a [[Special cities of South Korea|metropolitan city]] and was independent of [[South Jeolla Province]].

Its name is composed of the words ''gwang'' ({{Korean|hangul=광|hanja={{linktext|光}}}}) meaning "light" and ''ju'' ({{Korean|hangul=주|hanja={{linktext|州}}|labels=no}}) meaning "province". Gwangju was historically recorded as ''Muju'' ({{Korean |labels=no |hangul=무주 |hanja=武州}}), in which "[[Silla]] merged all of the land to establish the provinces of Gwangju, Ungju, Jeonju, Muju and various counties, plus the southern boundary of [[Goguryeo]] and the ancient territories of Silla" in the ''[[Samguk sagi]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gwangju.go.kr/contentsView.do?menuId=gwangju0505020000|title=Origin and History of Gwangju|website=www.gwangju.go.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-04-18|archive-date=18 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418161614/https://www.gwangju.go.kr/contentsView.do?menuId=gwangju0505020000|url-status=live}}</ref> In the heart of the agricultural [[Jeolla]] region, the city is also famous for its rich and diverse [[Korean regional cuisine#Jeolla province|cuisine]].

==History==
[[File:May 18th Memorial Monument.jpg|thumb|200px|A memorial to commemorate the lives lost in the 1980 [[Gwangju uprising]].]]
The city was established in 57 BC. It was one of the [[administrative center]]s of [[Baekje]] during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms period]].<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://eng.gwangju.go.kr/contentsView.do?menuId=gjeng0102020000|title=The History of Gwangju|access-date=25 April 2016|archive-date=30 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630175615/http://eng.gwangju.go.kr/contentsView.do?menuId=gjeng0102020000|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Imperial Japanese rule]], the city was known as Kōshū. In 1929, a confrontation between Korean and Japanese students in the city turned into [[Gwangju Student Independence Movement]], a regional demonstration, which culminated in one of the major nationwide uprisings against Imperial Japanese cruelty during the colonial period.

The modern industry was established in Gwangju with the construction of a railway to [[Seoul]]. Some of the industries that took hold include cotton textiles, rice mills and [[breweries]]. Construction of a designated industrial zone in 1967 encouraged growth in industry, especially in the sectors linked to the automobile industry.

In May 1980, peaceful demonstrations took place in Gwangju against [[Chun Doo-hwan]], leader of the military [[Coup d'état of December Twelfth|coup d'état of 12 December 1979]]. The demonstrations were suppressed by military forces, including elite units of the [[Special Operations Command Korea|Special Operations Command]]. The situation escalated after a violent crackdown, resulting in the [[Gwangju Uprising]], where civilians raided armories and armed themselves. By the time the uprising was suppressed 9 days later, many hundreds of civilians and several police forces / soldiers were dead. After civilian rule was reinstated in 1987, a national cemetery was established to honor the victims of the incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.gwangju.go.kr/contentsView.do?menuId=gjeng0102030000|title=May 18th Democratic Uprising|access-date=25 April 2016|archive-date=30 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630165741/http://eng.gwangju.go.kr/contentsView.do?menuId=gjeng0102030000|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1986, Gwangju separated from [[South Jeolla Province]] to become a Directly Governed City (Jikhalsi), and then became a Metropolitan City (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995.<ref name="auto"/>

Due to a variety of factors, including the ancient rivalry between [[Baekje]] and [[Silla]], as well as the biased priority given to the [[Gyeongsang Province]] region by political leaders in the 2nd half of the 20th century, Gwangju has a long history of voting for left-leaning politicians and is the main stronghold for the liberal [[Democratic Party (South Korea, 2015)|Democratic Party of Korea]] along with its predecessors, as well as the progressive [[Justice Party (South Korea)|Justice Party]].

Gwangju held many sports events such as [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], [[2015 Summer Universiade]], [[2019 World Aquatics Championships]].

==Administrative divisions==

==Climate==
Gwangju has a cooler version of the [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa/Cwa'') with four distinct seasons and rainfall year-round but particularly during the East Asian Monsoon Season in the summer months.

Winters, while still somewhat cold, are milder than in Seoul and cities further north due to the city's southwesterly position in the Korean peninsula. 
Summers are hot and humid with abundant precipitation, particularly in the form of thunderstorms. Gwangju is one of the warmest cities in Korea in the summer due to its geographic location.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}
