The region around Karachi has been the site of human habitation for millennia. [[Upper Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] sites have been excavated in the [[Mulri Hills]] along Karachi's northern outskirts. These earliest inhabitants are believed to have been [[hunter-gatherer]]s, with ancient [[flint tools]] discovered at several sites.

The expansive Karachi region is believed to have been known to the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], and may have been the site of [[Barbarikon]], an ancient seaport which was located at the nearby mouth of the [[Indus River]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Whitfield |first=Susan |author-link=Susan Whitfield |title=Silk, Slaves, and Stupas: Material Culture of the Silk Road |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHBdDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT118 |year=2018 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-95766-4 |page=118}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Chung |last2=Geng |first2=Yinzeng |title=India and China: twenty centuries of civilization interaction and vibrations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wx1uAAAAMAAJ |year=2005 |publisher=Project of History of Indian Science, Philosophy and Culture, Centre for Studies in Civilizations |isbn=978-81-87586-21-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkAaAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA159 |title=The Month |date=1912 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sun |first1=Zhixin Jason |author-link1=Zhixin Jason Sun |last2=Hsing |first2=I-tien |author-link2=I-tien Hsing |last3=Liu |first3=Cary Y. |author-link3=Cary Y.

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of Karachi|Environment of Karachi}}

Karachi is located on the coastline of Sindh province in southern Pakistan, along the [[Karachi Harbour]], a natural harbour on the [[Arabian Sea]]. Karachi is built on a coastal plain with scattered rocky outcroppings, hills and marshlands. [[Mangrove]] forests grow in the brackish waters around the Karachi Harbour (see: [[Chinna Creek]]), and farther southeast towards the expansive [[Indus River Delta]]. West of Karachi city is the [[Cape Monze]], locally known as [[Ras Muari]], which is an area characterised by sea cliffs, rocky sandstone promontories and beaches.

Karachi lies very close to a major fault line, where the [[Indian Plate|Indian tectonic plate]] meets the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian tectonic plate]].<ref>{{cite web |title=KARACHI: Karachi's earthquake history |date=26 October 2005 |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/162899/karachi-karachi-s-earthquake-history |access-date=28 August 2021 |archive-date=15 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210815083644/https://www.dawn.com/news/162899/karachi-karachi-s-earthquake-history |url-status=live }}</ref> However, Karachi lies near the western edge of the Indian Plate, on the Indo Gagnetic Plain. Within the city of Karachi are two small ranges: the [[Khasa Hills]] and [[Mulri Hills]], which lie in the northwest and act as a barrier between [[North Nazimabad]] and [[Orangi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=204319&Cat=4&dt=10/18/2009 |title=A story behind every name |date=21 October 2009 |website=The News International, Pakistan |access-date=14 June 2015 |archive-date=7 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007115813/http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=204319&Cat=4&dt=10%2F18%2F2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Karachi's hills are barren and are part of the larger [[Kirthar Range]], and have a maximum elevation of {{convert|528|m|abbr=off}}.<ref name=IIED>{{cite journal |last1=Hasan |first1=Arif |last2=Pervaiz |first2=Arif |last3=Raza |first3=Mansoor |title=Drivers of climate change vulnerability at different scales in Karachi |journal=IIED Working Paper |date=January 2017 |page=17 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep02723 |access-date=30 March 2024 |publisher=International Institute for Environment and Development |language=en |archive-date=30 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240330092124/https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep02723 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Between the hills are wide coastal plains interspersed with dry river beds and water channels. Karachi has developed around the [[Malir River]] and [[Lyari River]]s, with the Lyari shore being the site of the settlement for ''Kolachi''. To the east of Karachi lies the [[Indus River]] flood plains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dpu-projects/Global_Report/pdfs/Karachi.pdf |title=The case of Karachi, Pakistan |publisher=University College London |access-date=1 June 2016 |archive-date=15 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915074410/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dpu-projects/Global_Report/pdfs/Karachi.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Climate===

{{Main|Climate of Karachi}}
[[File:Karachi beach panorama.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Arabian Sea]] influences Karachi's climate, providing the city with more moderate temperatures compared to other areas of [[Sindh]] province.]]
Karachi has a tropical [[semi arid]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSh''), formerly a [[desert climate]], dominated by a long "Summer Season" while moderated by oceanic influence from the [[Arabian Sea]]. The city has annual average precipitation levels (approx. {{cvt|296|mm|0}} per annum), the bulk of which occurs during the late June–September [[monsoon]] season. Summers are hot and humid, and Karachi is prone to deadly heatwaves. Over the past 20 years, rainfall has become more abundant. Tropical storms and thunderstorms, as well as flooding are becoming more common, especially during the summer monsoon. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/22/where-world-hottest-city-kuwait-karachi-ahvaz |title=Where is the world's hottest city? |first=Hayley |last=Birch |date=22 July 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=3 March 2016 |archive-date=9 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201209050452/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/22/where-world-hottest-city-kuwait-karachi-ahvaz |url-status=live }}</ref> On the other hand, cool sea breezes typically provide relief during hot summer months. A text message-based early warning system alerts people to take precautionary measures and helps prevent fatalities during an unusually strong heatwave or thunderstorm.<ref name="heatwave">{{cite news |title=With Early Warning, Karachi Cools a Heat Wave Threat |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/early-warning-pakistan-heat-wave-threat/4115662.html |access-date=1 December 2017 |work=Voice of America |date=14 November 2017 |archive-date=1 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201182102/https://www.voanews.com/a/early-warning-pakistan-heat-wave-threat/4115662.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The winter climate is dry and lasts between December and February. It is dry and pleasant in winter relative to the warm hot season that follows, which starts in March and lasts until October. Proximity to the sea maintains humidity levels at near-constant levels year-round. Thus, the climate is similar to a humid tropical climate, except for the low precipitation and occasional temperatures well over 100 F (38 C) due to the influence of the Thar Desert nearby, close to the border with India.

The city's highest annual rainfall was about 750-850 mm, recorded in the late 1970s. The city's highest monthly rainfall, {{cvt|19|in}}, occurred in July 1967.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/opinion/pakistan-climate-change.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage |title=Pakistan's Most Terrifying Adversary Is Climate Change |date=27 September 2020 |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Fatima |last=Bhutto |access-date=25 May 2021 |archive-date=8 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210808203852/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/opinion/pakistan-climate-change.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="pakmet">{{cite web |url=http://www.pakmet.com.pk/cdpc/extrems/KARACHI.htm |title=Climate data&nbsp;– Karachi |publisher=Pakistan Meteorological Department, Government of Pakistan |access-date=24 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422011000/http://www.pakmet.com.pk/cdpc/extrems/KARACHI.htm |archive-date=22 April 2010}}</ref> The city's highest rainfall in 24 hours occurred on 7{{nbsp}}August 1953, when about {{convert|278.1|mm|in}} of rain lashed the city, resulting in major flooding.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://beta.dawn.com/news/206412/rain-havoc-in-karachi |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026221139/http://www.dawn.com/2006/08/18/top2.htm |url-status=dead |title=Rain havoc in Karachi |first=Dawn |last=Report |date=18 August 2006 |archive-date=26 October 2010 |website=DAWN.COM}}</ref>

===Cityscape===
{{Wide image|File:KHIURBANSKYLINE.jpg|1100px|Glimpse of [[I. I. Chundrigar Road]], as captured from the southern vantage point overlooking [[Chinna Creek]].}}
The city first developed around the Karachi Harbour, and owes much of its growth to its role as a seaport at the end of the 18th century,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gayer |first1=Laurent |title=Karachi: Ordered Disorder and the Struggle for the City |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=33}}</ref> contrasted with Pakistan's millennia-old cities such as [[Lahore]], [[Multan]], and [[Peshawar]]. Karachi's [[Mithadar]] neighbourhood represents the extent of ''Kolachi'' prior to British rule.

British Karachi was divided between the "New Town" and the "Old Town", with British investments focused primarily on the New Town.<ref name="Oxford University Press">{{cite book |last1=Gayer |first1=Laurent |title=Karachi: Ordered Disorder and the Struggle for the City |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-935444-3}}</ref> The Old Town was a largely unplanned neighbourhood which housed most of the city's indigenous residents and had no access to sewerage systems, electricity, and water.<ref name="Oxford University Press" /> The New Town was subdivided into residential, commercial, and military areas.<ref name="Oxford University Press" /> Given the strategic value of the city, the British developed the [[Karachi Cantonment]] as a military garrison in the New Town to aid the British war effort in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]].<ref name="Oxford University Press" />
The city's development was largely confined to the area north of the [[Chinna Creek]] prior to independence, although the seaside area of [[Clifton, Karachi|Clifton]] was also developed as a posh locale under the British, and its large bungalows and estates remain some of the city's most desirable properties. The aforementioned historic areas form the oldest portions of Karachi, and contain its most important monuments and government buildings, with the [[I. I. Chundrigar Road]] being home to most of Pakistan's banks, including the Habib Bank Plaza which was Pakistan's tallest building from 1963 until the early 2000s.<ref name="nadeemf.paracha" />
Situated on a coastal plain northwest of Karachi's historic core lies the sprawling district of [[Orangi]]. North of the historic core is the largely middle-class district of [[Nazimabad]], and upper-middle-class [[North Nazimabad]], which were developed in the 1950s. To the east of the historic core is the area known as [[Defence Housing Authority, Karachi|Defence]], an expansive upscale suburb developed and administered by the [[Pakistan Army]]. Karachi's coastal plains along the [[Arabian Sea]] south of Clifton were also developed much later as part of the greater Defence Housing Authority project.
Karachi's city limits also include several islands, including [[Baba and Bhit Islands]], Oyster Rocks, and [[Manora, Karachi|Manora]], a former island which is now connected to the mainland by a thin 12-kilometre long [[shoal]] known as [[Sandspit Beach|Sandspit]].<ref name=IIED/> [[Gulistan-e-Johar]], [[Gulshan Town|Gulshan-e-Iqbal]], [[Federal B. Area]], [[Malir]], [[Landhi Town|Landhi]] and [[Korangi Town|Korangi]] areas were all developed after 1970. The city has been described as one divided into sections for those able to afford to live in planned localities with access to urban amenities, and those who live in unplanned communities with inadequate access to such services.<ref name="Askari-2015">{{cite book |editor1-last=Askari |editor1-first=Sabiah |title=Studies on Karachi: Papers Presented at the Karachi Conference 2013 |date=2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Scholars |isbn=978-1-4438-8450-1}}</ref> 35% of Karachi's residents live in unplanned communities.<ref name="Askari-2015" />

As home to Pakistan's largest ports and a large portion of its manufacturing base, Karachi contributes a large share of Pakistan's collected tax revenue. As most of Pakistan's large multinational corporations are based in Karachi, income taxes are paid in the city even though income may be generated from other parts of the country.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Janjua |title=Karachi contributing 70% of federal tax revenue – a myth |url=http://www.brecorder.com/articles-a-letters/187:articles/1185461:karachi-contributing-70-of-federal-tax-revenue-a-myth/ |access-date=2 November 2016 |work=Business Recorder |date=13 October 2015 |archive-date=4 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104033351/http://www.brecorder.com/articles-a-letters/187:articles/1185461:karachi-contributing-70-of-federal-tax-revenue-a-myth/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> As home to the country's two largest ports, Pakistani customs officials collect the bulk of federal duty and tariffs at Karachi's ports, even if those imports are destined for one of Pakistan's other provinces.<ref>{{cite news |title=The importance of Karachi |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/971188/the-importance-of-karachi/ |access-date=2 November 2016 |work=The Express Tribune |date=12 October 2015 |archive-date=13 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113105825/http://tribune.com.pk/story/971188/the-importance-of-karachi/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Approximately 25% of Pakistan's national revenue is ''generated'' in Karachi.<ref name="adb" />

===Ethnicity===

==== Hinduism ====
[[File:Shri_Laxmi_Narayan_Mandir.JPG|thumb|Shri Laxmi Narayan Mandir]]
[[File:Karachi_Mandir.jpg|thumb|Shri Swami Narayan Mandir]]
While most of the city's Hindu population left ''en masse'' for India following Pakistan's independence, Karachi still has a large Hindu community with an estimated population of 250,000 based on 2013 data,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pakistanhinducouncil.org/hindupopulation.asp |title=Population of Hindus in the World |publisher=pakistanhinducouncil.org |access-date=21 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518031747/http://www.pakistanhinducouncil.org/hindupopulation.asp |archive-date=18 May 2013}}</ref> with several active temples in central Karachi. The Hindu community is split into a more affluent [[Sindhi Hindu]] and small [[Punjabi Hindus|Punjabi Hindu]] group that forms part of Karachi's educated middle class, while poorer Hindus of [[Rajasthani people|Rajasthani]] and [[Marwari people|Marwari]] descent form the other part and typically serve as menial and day laborers. Wealthier Hindus live primarily in [[Clifton, Karachi|Clifton]] and [[Saddar Town|Saddar]], while poorer ones live and have temples in [[Narayan Pura|Narayanpura]] and [[Lyari]]. Many streets in central Karachi still retain Hindu names, especially in [[Mithadar]], [[Aram Bagh, Karachi|Aram Bagh]] (formerly Ram Bagh), and Ramswami. Many Mandirs exist in [[Saddar Town|Saddar]] which are over 100 years old.

==== Zoroastrianism ====

Karachi's affluent and influential [[Zoroastrian|Parsis]] have lived in the region in the 12th century, though the modern community dates from the mid 19th century when they served as military contractors and commissariat agents to the British.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hinnells |first1=John |title=The Zoroastrian Diaspora: Religion and Migration |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-151350-3 |page=199 |date=28 April 2005}}</ref> Further waves of Parsi immigrants from [[Persia]] settled in the city in the late 19th century.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hinnells |first1=John |title=The Zoroastrian Diaspora: Religion and Migration |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-151350-3 |page=202 |date=28 April 2005}}</ref> The population of Parsis in Karachi and throughout South Asia is in continuous decline due to low birth-rates and migration to Western countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=Why is India's wealthy Parsi community vanishing? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35219331 |access-date=17 November 2016 |publisher=BBC |date=9 January 2016 |archive-date=20 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120095149/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35219331 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2022, provincial government launched [[Peoples Bus Service]] having fleet size of 100+ which run on 12 different routes on nominal fare. The buses are air-conditioned, have wifi, have priority seeting for disabled and elderly and are wheelchair accessible.

Red buses are for general public. Pink buses are for women only. White buses are environment friendly electric buses having designated charging points.

====Karachi Circular Railway====
[[Karachi Circular Railway]] is a partially active regional [[public transport|public transit system]] in Karachi, which serves the [[Karachi District|Karachi metropolitan area]]. KCR was fully operational between 1969 and 1999. Since 2001, restoration of the railway and restarting the system had been sought.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nation.com.pk/10-Aug-2020/chairman-railways-visits-kcr-track |title=Chairman Railways visits KCR track |date=10 August 2020 |access-date=28 August 2021 |archive-date=14 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210114150332/https://nation.com.pk/10-Aug-2020/chairman-railways-visits-kcr-track |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/2260409/supreme-court-gives-four-more-months-to-overhaul-railways |title=Supreme Court gives four more months to overhaul railways |date=20 August 2020 |access-date=28 August 2021 |archive-date=20 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210820124938/https://tribune.com.pk/story/2260409/supreme-court-gives-four-more-months-to-overhaul-railways |url-status=live }}</ref> In November 2020, the KCR partially revived operations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1591237/karachi-circular-railway-begins-partial-operations-today |title=Karachi Circular Railway begins partial operations |date=19 November 2020 |access-date=28 August 2021 |archive-date=14 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210814091641/https://www.dawn.com/news/1591237/karachi-circular-railway-begins-partial-operations-today |url-status=live }}</ref>

KCR was included in [[China-Pakistan Economic Corridor|CPEC]] by [[Shehbaz Sharif]] and construction started in 2022. Existing 43&nbsp;km KCR track and stations would be completely rebuilt into [[automated]] [[rapid transit]] system with [[electric locomotive|electric trains]]. The route would not be changed however many underpasses and bridges would be built along the route to eliminate 22-level crossings. New KCR would be similar to [[Lahore]]'s [[Orange Line (Lahore Metro)|Orange Train]]. New KCR would have joint stations with [[Karachi Breeze|Karachi Metrobus]] at points of intersection. Project would be operational by 2025.

With its hub at [[Karachi City railway station|Karachi City station]] on [[I. I. Chundrigar Road]], KCR will connect the city centre with several industrial, commercial and residential districts within the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/karachicircularrailw/ |title=Karachi Circular Railway Revival, Pakistan |publisher=railway-technology.com |access-date=4 October 2012 |archive-date=7 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007082233/http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/karachicircularrailw/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===City government===

{{Main|Government of Karachi}}

Karachi has a fragmented system of civic government. The urban area is divided into six District Municipal Corporations: [[Karachi East District|Karachi East]], [[Karachi West District|Karachi West]], [[Karachi Central District|Karachi Central]], [[Karachi South District|Karachi South]], [[Malir District|Malir]], [[Korangi District|Korangi.]] Each district is further divided into between 22 and 42 Union Committees. Each Union Committee is represented by seven elected representatives, four of whom can be general candidates of any background; the other three seats are reserved for women, religious minorities, and a union representative or peasant farmer.

Karachi's urban area also includes six [[Cantonment (Pakistan)|cantonments]], which are administered directly by the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistani military]], and include some of Karachi's most desirable real-estate.

Key civic bodies, such as the [[Karachi Water and Sewerage Board]] and KBCA (Karachi Building Control Authority), among others, are under the direct control of the [[Government of Sindh]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1225311 |title=Sindh govt takes away key municipal function from local bodies |last=Azfar-ul-Ashfaque |date=10 December 2015 |website=Dawn |location=Pakistan |access-date=6 April 2020 |archive-date=6 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200406234255/https://www.dawn.com/news/1225311 |url-status=live }}</ref> Additionally, Karachi's city-planning authority for undeveloped land, the [[Karachi Development Authority]], is under control of the government, while two new city-planning authorities, the [[Lyari Development Authority]] and [[Malir Development Authority]] were revived by the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] government in 2011{{snd}}allegedly to patronize their electoral allies and voting banks.<ref name="Hasan" />

====Historical background====

In response to a cholera epidemic in 1846, the [[Karachi Conservancy Board]] was organized by British administrators to control its spread.<ref name=cdgkhistory>{{cite web |url=http://221.132.118.186/cdgk/Home/Government/CDGKHistory/tabid/276/Default.aspx |title=CDGK History |publisher=City-District Government of Karachi |access-date=24 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417020709/http://221.132.118.186/cdgk/Home/Government/CDGKHistory/tabid/276/Default.aspx |archive-date=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Culture, Religion and Lifestyle in Karachi |website=Karachi History |date=14 August 2001 |url=http://www.karachi.com/v/history/ |access-date=5 August 2017 |archive-date=6 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806020334/http://www.karachi.com/v/history/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The board became the Karachi Municipal Commission in 1852, and the [[Karachi Municipal Committee]] the following year.<ref name=cdgkhistory /> The City of Karachi Municipal Act of 1933 transformed the city administration into the [[Karachi Municipal Corporation]] with a mayor, a deputy mayor and 57 councillors.<ref name=cdgkhistory /> In 1976, the body became the [[Karachi Metropolitan Corporation]].<ref name=cdgkhistory />

During the 1900s, Karachi saw its major beautification project under the mayoralty of [[Harchandrai Vishandas]]. New roads, parks, residential, and recreational areas were developed as part of this project. In 1948, the [[Federal Capital Territory (Pakistan)|Federal Capital Territory]] of Pakistan was created, comprising approximately {{cvt|2103|km2}} of Karachi and surrounding areas, but this was merged into the province of [[West Pakistan]] in 1959.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statoids.com/upk.html |title=Pakistan Provinces |publisher=Statoids.com |access-date=24 August 2010 |archive-date=29 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729165316/http://www.statoids.com/upk.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1960, Karachi and Lasbela District merged to create Karachi-Bela Division.

In 2001, during the rule of [[Pervez Musharraf|General Pervez Musharraf]], five districts of Karachi were merged to form the city district of Karachi, with a three-tier structure. The two most local tiers are composed of 18 [[Tehsil|towns]], and 178 [[Union councils of Pakistan|union councils]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://221.132.118.186/cdgk/Home/Towns/tabid/72/Default.aspx |title=CDGK Towns |publisher=City District Government of Karachi |access-date=24 August 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Each tier focused on elected councils with some common members to provide "vertical linkage" within the federation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrb.gov.pk/local_government/default.asp |title=Local Government |publisher=National Reconstruction Bureau, Government of Pakistan |access-date=24 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125014524/http://nrb.gov.pk/local_government/default.asp |archive-date=25 January 2009}}</ref>

===City planning===

The [[Karachi Development Authority]] (KDA), along with the [[Lyari Development Authority]] (LDA) and [[Malir Development Authority]] (MDA), is responsible for the development of most undeveloped land around Karachi. KDA came into existence in 1957 with the task of managing land around Karachi, while the LDA and MDA were formed in 1993 and 1994, respectively. KDA under the control of Karachi's local government and mayor in 2001, while the LDA and MDA were abolished. KDA was later placed under the direct control of the [[Government of Sindh]] in 2011. The LDA and MDA were also revived by the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] government at the time, allegedly to patronize their electoral allies and voting banks.<ref name="Hasan">{{Cite journal |last=Hasan |first=Arif |title=Land ownership, control and contestation in Karachi and implications for low-income housing |url=https://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/10625IIED.pdf |journal=International Institute for Environment and Development United Nations Population Fund |access-date=6 April 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803054815/https://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/10625IIED.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> City-planning in Karachi, therefore, is not locally directed but is instead controlled at the provincial level.

Each District Municipal Corporation regulate land-use in developed areas, while the Sindh Building Control Authority ensures that building construction is in accordance with building & town planning regulations. Cantonment areas, and the [[Defence Housing Authority, Karachi|Defence Housing Authority]] are administered and planned by the military.

==Municipal services==
===Water===

Municipal water supplies are managed by the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KW&SB), which supplies 640&nbsp;million gallons daily (MGD) to the city (excluding the city's steel mills and [[Port Qasim]]), of which 440 MGD are filtered/treated.<ref name="shehri.org-2018" /> Most of the supply comes from the [[Indus River]], and 90 MGD from the [[Hub Dam]].<ref name="shehri.org-2018" /> Karachi's water supply is transported to the city through a complex network of canals, conduits, and siphons, with the aid of pumping and filtration stations.<ref name="shehri.org-2018" /> 80% of Karachi households have access to piped water {{as of|2022|lc=y}},<ref name="SPDC"/> with private water tankers supplying much of the water required in informal settlements.<ref name="Pakistan Development Update-2016"/> 15% of residents in a 2022 survey rated their water supply as "bad" or "very bad", while 40% expressed concern at the stability of water supply.<ref name="SPDC"/> By 2022, an estimated 35,000 people were dying due to water-borne diseases annually.{{sfn|Yamini Narayanan|2015|p=165}}

The '''[[K-IV water project]]''' is under development at a cost of $876&nbsp;million. It would connect [[Keenjhar Lake]] to Karachi hence eradicating water scarcity in eastern and northern parts of the city. It is expected to supply 650&nbsp;million gallons daily of potable water to the city, the first phase 260&nbsp;million gallons upon completion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pakistan to award Karachi water supply project to Frontier Works Organisation |url=http://www.water-technology.net/news/newspakistan-to-award-karachi-water-supply-project-to-frontier-works-organisation-4810766/ |access-date=29 November 2017 |agency=Water Technology |date=15 February 2016 |archive-date=1 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041215/http://www.water-technology.net/news/newspakistan-to-award-karachi-water-supply-project-to-frontier-works-organisation-4810766/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Ist phase of K-IV project to be completed in June: Gov |url=http://nation.com.pk/22-Nov-2017/ist-phase-of-k-iv-project-to-be-completed-in-june-gov |access-date=29 November 2017 |work=The Nation |date=22 November 2017 |archive-date=28 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128205355/http://nation.com.pk/22-Nov-2017/ist-phase-of-k-iv-project-to-be-completed-in-june-gov |url-status=live }}</ref>

Desalination plants are also planned to be built on Arabian Sea coast on western side of Karachi in near future. These would resolve water scarcity issues in western parts of the city including SITE Area, Shershah and Orangi Town.

===Sanitation===

98% of Karachi's households are connected to the city's underground public sewerage system,<ref name="SPDC"/> largely operated by the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KW&SB). The KW&SB operates 150 pumping stations, 25 bulk reservoirs, over 10,000 kilometres of pipes, and 250,000 manholes.<ref name="shehri.org-2018" /> The city generates approximately 472&nbsp;million gallons daily (MGD) of sewage, of which 417 MGD are discharged without treatment.<ref name="shehri.org-2018" /> KW&SB has the optimum capacity to treat up to 150 MGD of sewage, but uses only about 50 MGD of this capacity.<ref name="shehri.org-2018" /> Three treatment plants are available, in [[SITE Town]] (Gutter Baghicha), [[Mahmudabad, Karachi|Mehmoodabad]], and Mauripur.<ref name="shehri.org-2018" /> 75% reported in 2022 that Karachi's drainage system overflows or backs up,<ref name="SPDC" /> the highest percentage of all major Pakistani cities.<ref name="SPDC" /> Parts of the city's drainage system overflow on average 2–7 times per month, flooding some city streets.<ref name="SPDC" />

Households in [[Orangi]] self-organized to set-up their own sewerage system under the '''[[Orangi Pilot Project]]''',<ref name="sewer" /> a community service organization founded in 1980. 90% of Orangi streets are now connected to a sewer system built by local residents under the Orangi Pilot Project.<ref name="sewer" /> Residents of individual streets bear the cost of sewerage pipes, and provide volunteer labour to lay the pipe.<ref name="sewer" /> Residents also maintain the sewer pipes,<ref name="sewer" /> while the city municipal administration has built several primary and secondary pipes for the network.<ref name="sewer" /> As a result of OPP, 96% of Orangi residents have access to a latrine.<ref name="sewer" />

The Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) is responsible for the collection and disposal of solid waste, not only in Karachi but throughout the whole province. Karachi has the highest percentage of residents in Pakistan who report that their streets are never cleaned{{snd}}42% of residents in Karachi report their streets are never cleaned, compared to 10% of residents in [[Lahore]].<ref name="SPDC"/> Only 17% of Karachi residents reporting daily street cleaning, compared to 45%

===Electricity===
The one and only electricity providing company in Karachi is [[K-Electric]]. It was government owned but was privatised in 2019. Government still has some shares. However [[HUBCO]] is an Independent Power Producer (IPP) that owns few major powerplants.

Karachi mostly gets electricity from oil, gas and coal powerplants established either on western coastline or [[Port Qasim]] Industrial Zone. Most recently built coal powerplants were the 1320MW Port Qasim Powerplant and the 1320MW Hub Coal Powerplant. 3 Nuclear Powerplants on western coastline namely [[Karachi Nuclear Power Complex|KANUPP]] (K-1, K-2, K-3) also feed Karachi. [[Jhimpir]], a nearby town has Wind Powerplants of more than 1000MW. This capacity is going to increase in future expansions. Solar Parks are envisioned to be established on western coastline having a starting generation of 1000MW.

75% of Karachi receives uninterrupted power supply almost throughout the year. 25% areas including industrial areas suffer with up to 6 hours of [[power outage]]s everyday due to energy generation deficit. Power outages increase further in Peak-summer and [[Monsoon]] season (May to August). Many [[slum]]s and unregulated areas are not yet electrified hence they indulge in electricity theft which is locally called Kunda-System.

===Police, Ambulance, Firefighting===
Police is under the control of provincial government and city government has no authority over it. Ambulance is run by private hospitals or NGOs, the most famous of which are Edhi, Chhipa and JDC. Firefighting is under control of local government and has enough firefighters and vehicles to work quickly during fire.

Urban planning and service delivery have not kept pace with Karachi's growth, resulting in the city's low ranking on livability rankings.<ref name="Pakistan Development Update-2016"/> The city has no cohesive transportation policy and inadequate transport, though up to 1,000 new vehicles are added daily to the city's congested streets.<ref name="Pakistan Development Update-2016"/> Roads and streets are broken at many places but are not repaired in timely manner.

Air quality index is one of the worst in the world. Due to desert terrain, there is plenty of dust throughout the year except for rainy season. Vehicles and industries also contribute to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. There is a lot of noise pollution due to traffic.

===Urban flooding in monsoon season===
Size of Drainage system and storm water drains (locally known as Naalahs) in the city is not enough to handle the heavy rainfalls of monsoon. The drainage system and storm water drains are also filled with solid trash. When water finds no path, it enters streets, roads, underpasses and even houses during rainfall in July and August of every year. Major Naalahs like Orangi Naalah, Gujjar Naalah, Mehmoodabad Naalah are cleaned every year by government but are polluted by people the next day.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ilyas |first=Faiza |date=8 July 2018 |title=Encroached drains, poor waste management put Karachi at risk of urban flooding |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1418576 |access-date=28 November 2023 |website=DAWN.COM |archive-date=8 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708062341/https://www.dawn.com/news/1418576 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Karachi acquired its first neo-Gothic or Indo-Gothic buildings when [[Frere Hall]], [[Empress Market]] and [[Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Karachi|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] were completed. The [[Mock Tudor]] architectural style was introduced in the [[Karachi Gymkhana]] and the [[Karachi Boat Club|Boat Club]].

The procedure involved the careful removal of each piece of timber and stone, stacked temporarily, loaded on the trucks for transportation to the Clifton site, unloaded and re-arranged according to a given layout, stone by stone, piece by piece, and completed within three months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indusvalley.edu.pk/nusserwanjeehistory.html |title=Nusserwanjee Building (Relocation) Project |website=Daily Times |access-date=26 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126022502/http://www.indusvalley.edu.pk/nusserwanjeehistory.html |archive-date=26 January 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Architecturally distinctive, even eccentric, buildings have sprung up throughout Karachi. Notable example of contemporary architecture include the [[Pakistan State Oil]] Headquarters building. The city has examples of modern [[Islamic architecture]], including the [[Aga Khan University]] hospital, [[Grand Jamia Mosque]], [[Masjid e Tooba]], Faran Mosque, [[Baitul Mukarram Mosque]], Quaid's Mausoleum, and the [[Textile Institute of Pakistan]]. One of the unique cultural elements of Karachi is that the residences, which are two- or three-story [[townhouse]]s, are built with the front yard protected by a high brick wall. [[I. I. Chundrigar Road]] features a range of tall buildings. The most prominent examples include the [[Habib Bank Plaza]], UBL Tower, PRC Towers, PNSC Building and [[MCB Tower]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcb.com.pk/mcb/mcb_tower.asp |title=MCB Tower, the tallest skyscraper of Karachi |publisher=Mcb.com.pk |access-date=6 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504064133/http://www.mcb.com.pk/mcb/mcb_tower.asp |archive-date=4 May 2009}}</ref> Newer skyscrapers are being built in Clifton.
