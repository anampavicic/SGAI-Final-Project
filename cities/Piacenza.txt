'''Piacenza''' ({{IPA|it|pjaˈtʃɛntsa|lang|It-Piacenza.ogg}}; {{langx|egl|label=[[Piacentino dialect|Piacentino]]|Piaṡëinsa}} {{IPA-egl|pi.aˈzəi̯sɐ|}}; {{Langx|la|Placentia}}) is a city and {{lang|it|[[comune]]}} (municipality) in the [[Emilia-Romagna]] region of [[Northern Italy]], and the capital of the [[province of Piacenza|eponymous province]]. As of 2022, Piacenza is the ninth largest city in the region by population, with more than 102,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Top 10 Cities of Emilia-Romagna by Population|url=https://www.top10cities.net/country/italy-emiliaromagna.php|access-date=2022-10-18|website=www.top10cities.net|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Comuni della Provincia di Piacenza per popolazione|url=https://www.tuttitalia.it/emilia-romagna/provincia-di-piacenza/97-comuni/popolazione/|access-date=2022-10-18|website=Tuttitalia.it|language=it}}</ref>

Westernmost major city of the region of Emilia-Romagna, it has strong relations with [[Lombardy]], with which it borders, and in particular with [[Milan]]. It was defined by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] as a "Land of passage" in his [[Codex Atlanticus]], by virtue of its crucial geographical location.<ref>{{Cite web|title=L'arte della|url=https://www.visitemilia.com/itinerari/larte-della-terra-di-passo|access-date=2022-10-18|website=Visit Emilia - visit the Italian food valley|language=it}}</ref> This strategic location would influence the history of Piacenza significantly at several times.

Piacenza integrates characteristics of the nearby [[Liguria]]n and [[Piedmont]]ese territories added to a prevalent Lombard influence, favored by communications with the nearby metropolis, which attenuate its [[Emilia (region)|Emilian]] footprint.<ref>{{Cite web|title=PIACENZA in "Enciclopedia Italiana"|url=https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/piacenza_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)|access-date=2022-10-18|website=www.treccani.it|language=it-IT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Urbano|first=Andrea|date=2020-09-14|title=PIACENZA, l'eterna sposa mancata di Milano: 5 motivi per farla diventare LOMBARDA|url=https://www.milanocittastato.it/grande-milano/eterna-sposa-mancata/|access-date=2022-10-18|website=Milano Città Stato|language=it-IT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-08-04|title=Tagli alle province, la secessione di Piacenza: "Meglio Lombardia che Parma"|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2012/08/04/spending-review-secessione-della-provincia-di-piacenza-meglio-lombardia-che-parma/316489/|access-date=2022-10-18|website=Il Fatto Quotidiano|language=it-IT}}</ref>

Piacenza is located at a major crossroads at the intersection of Route E35/A1 between [[Bologna]] and [[Milan]], and Route E70/A21 between [[Brescia]] and [[Turin]]. Piacenza is also at the confluence of the [[Trebbia]], draining the northern [[Apennine Mountains]], and the [[Po (river)|River Po]], draining to the east.

Piacenza hosts three universities, [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]], [[Polytechnic University of Milan]] and [[University of Parma]].

== Etymology ==
The etymology is long-standing, deriving from the Latin "Placentia" tracing an origin from the verb {{Wikt-lang|la|placēre}}, "to please".<ref>{{cite book|title=Local Etymology: A Derivative Dictionary of Geographical Names|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC|first=Richard Stephen|last=Charnock|publisher=Houlston and Wright|year=1859|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n219 209]}}</ref> The name means "pleasant" or (as [[James Boswell]] reported some of the etymologists of his time to have translated it) "comely abode",<ref>{{cite book|title=Catalogue of the Papers of James Boswell at Yale University|volume=I|first=Marion S.|last=Pottle|author2=Claude Colleer Abbott|author3=Frederick A.

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Piacenza}}

=== Ancient history ===

==== Pre-Roman era ====
Before its settlement by the Romans, the area was populated by other peoples; specifically, just prior to the Roman settlement, the region on the right bank of the Po River between the [[Trebbia|Trebbia River]] and the [[Taro (river)|Taro River]] had been occupied by the Ananes or Anamari, a tribe of [[Cisalpine Gaul]]s.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, illustrated by numerous engravings on wood|first=William|last=Smith|author-link=William Smith (lexicographer)|location=London|publisher=Walton and Maberly; John Murray|year=1854|title=Ananes|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=ananes-geo&highlight=placentia}} Smith cites [[Polybius]], ''Histories'', Book II, sections 17 and 32.</ref> Before then, according to [[Polybius]],<ref>''Histories'' II.17.</ref> "These plains were anciently inhabited by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]" before the Gauls took the entire [[Po Valley]] from them.

==== Roman age ====
in May 218 BC, Piacenza and [[Cremona]] were founded as Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|military colonies]]. The Romans had planned to construct them after the successful conclusion of the latest war with the Gauls ending in 219 BC. In the spring of 218 BC, after declaring war on [[Carthage]], the Senate decided to accelerate the foundation and gave the colonists 30 days to appear on the sites to receive their lands. Each colony was to be settled by 6,000 Roman citizens, but the cities were to receive [[Latin Rights]];<ref>[[Polybius]] III.40, [[Livy]] XXI.25.</ref> that is, they were to have the same legal status as the many colonies that had been co-founded by Rome and towns of [[Latium]].

The reaction of the region's Gauls was swift; they drove the colonists off the lands. Taking refuge in [[Modena|Mutina]], the colonists sent for military assistance. A small force under Lucius Manlius was prevented from reaching the area. The Senate then sent two legions under Gaius Atelius. Collecting Manlius and the colonists, they descended on Piacenza and Cremona and successfully placed [[castra]] there of {{convert|480|m2|acre}} to support the building of the city. Piacenza must have been walled immediately, as the walls were in place when the [[Battle of the Trebia]] was fought around the city in December. There is no evidence either textual or archaeological of a prior settlement at that exact location; however, such a site would have been obliterated by construction. Piacenza was the fifty-third colony to be placed by Rome following its foundation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Roman Italy|volume=1|first=T. W.|last=Potter|edition=reprint|publisher=University of California Press|year=1990|ISBN=978-0-520-06975-6|pages=57–58}}</ref> It was the first among the Gauls of the Po valley.

It had to be supplied by boat after the Battle of Trebbia, when Hannibal controlled the countryside, for which purpose a port (Emporium) was constructed. In 209 BC, [[Hasdrubal Barca]] crossed the Alps and laid siege to the city, but he was unable to take it, and he withdrew.<ref>[[Livy]] ''History of Rome'' XXVII.39, 43.</ref> In 200 BC, the Gauls sacked and burned the city, selling the inhabitants into slavery.<ref>[[Livy]] ''History of Rome'' XXXI.10.</ref> Subsequently, the victorious Romans restored the city and managed to recover 2,000 of its citizens. In 198 BC, a combined force of Gauls and Ligurians plundered the whole region. As the people had never recovered from being sold into slavery, in 190 BC, they complained to Senate of underpopulation; in response the Senate sent 3,000 new settlers.<ref>[[Livy]] ''History of Rome'' XXXVII.46-47.</ref> Construction of the [[Via Aemilia]] in the decade of the 180s made the city easily accessible from the Adriatic ports, which improved trade and the prospects for timely defense.

The [[Liver of Piacenza]], a bronze model of a sheep's liver for the purposes of [[haruspex|haruspicy]] was discovered in 1877 at [[Gossolengo]] just to the south of Piacenza. It bears witness to the survival of the ''[[Etruscan mythology#Etrusca Disciplina|disciplina Etrusca]]'' well after the Roman conquest.

Although sacked and devastated several times, the city always recovered and by the sixth century [[Procopius]] was calling it "the principal city in the country of Aemilia".<ref>[[Procopius]] ''History of the Wars'' Book VII chapter XIII.</ref>

The first Bishop of Piacenza (322–357), San Vittorio, declared [[Saint Antoninus of Piacenza]], a soldier of the [[Theban Legion]] (and not to be confused with the sixth-century [[Antoninus of Piacenza (pilgrim)|Antoninus of Piacenza]]), the patron saint of Piacenza and had the first basilica constructed to honor the saint in 324. The basilica was restored in 903 and rebuilt in 1101,<ref>{{cite book|page=752|title=The manual of dates: a dictionary of reference to all the most important events in the history of mankind to be found in authentic records|first=George Henry|last=Townsend|edition=5|publisher=Frederick Warne|year=1877|location=London}}</ref> again in 1562, and is still a church today. The remains of the bishop and the [[military saint|soldier-saint]] are in urns under the altar. The theme of Antoninus, protector of Piacenza, is well known in art.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Antico Stemma Piacenza.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the old coat of arms for the city, bearing a horse with one raised leg]]
Piacenza was sacked during the course of the [[Gothic War (535–554)]]. After a short period of being reconquered by the [[Roman emperor]] [[Justinian I]], it was conquered by the [[Lombards]], who made it a duchy seat. After its conquest by [[Francia]] in the ninth century, the city began to recover, aided by its location along the [[Via Francigena]] that later connected the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with [[Rome]]. Its population and importance grew further after the year 1000. That period marked a gradual transfer of governing powers from the feudal lords to a new enterprising class, as well to the feudal class of the countryside.

In 1095, the city was the site of the [[Council of Piacenza]], in which the [[First Crusade]] was proclaimed. From 1126, Piacenza was a free [[medieval commune|commune]] and an important member of the [[Lombard League]]. In this role, it took part in the war against [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and in the subsequent [[battle of Legnano]] (1176). It also successfully fought the neighbouring communes of [[Cremona]], [[Pavia]], and [[Parma]], expanding its territory. Piacenza also captured control of the trading routes with [[Genoa]], where the first Piacentini bankers had already settled, from the Malaspina counts and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bobbio|bishop of Bobbio]].

In the thirteenth century, despite unsuccessful wars against Frederick I, Piacenza managed to gain strongholds on the [[Lombardy]] shore of the Po. The preliminaries of the [[Peace of Constance]] were signed in 1183 in the Saint Antoninus church. Agriculture and trade flourished in these centuries and Piacenza became one of the richest cities in Europe. This is reflected in the construction of many important buildings and in the general revision of the urban plan. Struggles for control were commonplace in the second half of the thirteenth century, similarly to the large majority of Medieval Italian communes. The [[Scotti family]], [[Pallavicini family]] and {{ill|Alberto Scoto|it}} (1290–1313) in that order, held power during the period. Scoto's government ended when the [[Visconti of Milan]] captured Piacenza, which they would hold until 1447. Duke [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] rewrote Piacenza's statutes and relocated the [[University of Pavia]] to the city. Piacenza then became a possession of the [[House of Sforza]] until 1499.

=== Modern era ===
{{see also|Duchy of Parma and Piacenza}}
[[File:Italian States-Piacenza 1626 2 Doppie.jpg|thumb|Two gold Doppie (1626) depicting [[Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma|Odoardo Farnese]] (obv) and ''Placentia floret'' ("Piacenza flourishes") (rev)]]
Chiefly due to the expansion of [[agriculture]] in the countryside surrounding Piacenza, the city progressed economically and a coin from the sixteenth century (that is displayed to the right) declares that by featuring the motto: ''Placentia floret'' ("Piacenza flourishes") on one of its sides. Also in the course of that century a new city wall was erected. Piacenza, as part of the [[Duchy of Milan]], was ruled, at alternate times, by the Sforza and by [[France]] until 1521, when, under [[Pope Leo X]], it became part of the [[Papal States]]. From 1545, following the creation of the [[Duchy of Parma and Piacenza]] by [[Pope Paul III]] to his son [[Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma|Pier Luigi Farnese]], the city was ruled by the [[House of Farnese]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Amadasi|first=Giorgio|title=DUCATO DI PARMA E PIACENZA E LA FAMIGLIA FARNESE|url=https://www.muet.it/storie/tutte-le-storie/item/ducato-di-parma-e-piacenza-e-la-famiglia-farnese.html|access-date=2022-04-18|website=www.muet.it|language=it-IT}}</ref>

Piacenza was the capital city of the duchy until [[Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma]] (1547–1586), moved the capital to Parma. The city underwent some of its most difficult years during the rule of [[Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma]] (1622–1646). Out of the population of 30,000 in the city between 6,000 and 13,000 Piacentini died from famine and plague. The city and its countryside were ravaged by bandits and French soldiers as well.

[[File:I Francesi passano il Po a Piacenza Bagetti.jpg|thumb|''The French Pass the River Po at Piacenza'', by Giuseppe Pietro Bagetti, 1803]]
Between 1732 and 1859, Parma and Piacenza were ruled by the [[House of Bourbon]]. In the eighteenth century, several edifices that belonged to noble families such as Scotti, [[Landi family|Landi]], and Fogliani were built in Piacenza.

In 1802, [[Napoleon]]'s army annexed Piacenza to the French Empire. Young Piacentini recruits were sent to fight in [[Russia]], [[Spain]], and [[Germany]], while the city was plundered of a great number of artworks that are currently exhibited in many French museums.

The [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] government of [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]] (1816–1847), is remembered fondly as one of the best in the history of Piacenza. The duchess drained many lands, built several bridges across the Trebbia and the [[Nure]] and created educational and artistic activities.

=== Union with Italy ===
[[File:PontePo.jpg|thumb|Piacenza railway bridge over [[Po river]] in a 19th-century image]]
[[Austria]]n troops occupied Piacenza until, in 1860, a plebiscite marked the entrance of the city into the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. When 37,089 voters out of 37,585 voted for the annexation, Piacenza was declared ''Primogenita dell'Unità di Italia'' ("First-born of the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]]") by the monarch. The Piacentini enrolled en masse in [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s army for the [[Expedition of the Thousand]].

In 1858, the geologist Karl Mayer-Eymar named the [[Piacenzian]] Age of the [[Pliocene]] Epoch based on deposits close to Piacenza.

In June 1865, the first railway bridge over the Po River in northern Italy was inaugurated (in southern Italy a railroad bridge had been built across the river in 1839). In 1891, the first Chamber of Workers was created in Piacenza.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

=== World War II ===
During [[World War II]], the city was heavily bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] because of its strategic elements. The important railway and road bridges across the Trebbia and the Po and the railway yards were destroyed. The historic centre of city suffered collateral damage. In 1944, the bridges over the Po became vital for the supply from Austria of Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]]'s [[Gothic Line]], which protected the withdrawal of Kesselring's troops from Italy. Foremost among these were the railway and road bridges at Piacenza, along with supply depots and railway yards. In Operation Mallory Major, July 12–15, allied medium bombers from [[Corsica]] flew 300 sorties a day, knocking out 21 bridges east of Piacenza and then continued to the west for a total of 90 by July 20. Fighter-bombers prevented reconstruction and cut roads and rail lines. By August 4, all the cities of northern Italy were isolated and had suffered heavy bombing, especially Piacenza. Transport to Genoa to the south or through Turin to the north was impossible; nevertheless, Kesselring continued to supply his men.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Army Air Forces in World War II|editor-first=Wesley Frank|editor-last=Craven|editor2=James Lea Cate|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=1983|isbn=9780912799032|pages=404–407}}</ref>

On the hills and the Apennine Mountains, [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] were active. On April 25, 1945, a general partisan insurrection by the [[Italian resistance movement]] broke out and on 29 April, troops of the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] entered the city. In 1996, president [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]] honoured Piacenza with the gold medal for Valour in Battle.

There was a [[List of World War II prisoner-of-war camps in Italy|prisoner of war (POW)]] camp located in Piacenza, Veano Camp PG 29.

== Dialect ==
{{see also|Languages of Italy|Emilian-Romagnol language}}
Many inhabitants of Piacenza and the surrounding province still use Piacentino, which is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the [[Emilian dialect]] the [[Emilian-Romagnol language]]. Emilian-Romagnol is a member of a different Romance subfamily ([[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic]]) than Standard Italian (which is an [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian language]]) and its distinct grammar and phonology make it mutually unintelligible with that language.

Although there have been a number of notable poets and writers using Piacentino, the language has experienced a steady decline during the twentieth century due to the growing standardization of the Italian language in the national educational system.

== Sport ==
[[Piacenza Calcio 1919]] is the main and most supported football team and played in Serie A for eight seasons. They play at the [[Stadio Leonardo Garilli]].

The city's other club, [[A.S. Pro Piacenza 1919|Pro Piacenza 1919]], declared bankruptcy in 2019.

[[Pallavolo Piacenza|Volley Piacenza]] is the main men's volleyball team and currently plays in serie A1; its palmares entails a championship, a national cup, a national supercup, and two European cups. River Volley is the main women's volleyball team and won the national championship twice.

Rugby is relatively popular compared with Italian standards and Piacenza has a number of rugby teams: Piacenza Rugby Club and [[Rugby Lyons Piacenza]] are the most important.

== Cuisine ==
{{see also|Italian cuisine#Emilia-Romagna|List of Italian dishes#Emilia-Romagna}}
Piacenza and its province are known for the production of seasoned and salted pork products. The main specialities are ''[[pancetta]]'' (rolled seasoned pork belly, salted and spiced), ''[[Capicola|coppa]]'' (seasoned pork neck, containing less fat than ''pancetta'', matured at least for six months), and ''[[Salami|salame]]'' (chopped pork meat flavoured with spices and wine, and made into [[sausage]]s).

''Bortellina'' (salted pancakes made with flour, salt, and water or milk) and ''chisulén'' (''torta fritta'' in Standard Italian; made with flour, milk, and animal fats mixed together and then fried in hot ''strutto'', or clarified pork fat) are considered the perfect coupling of ''pancetta'', ''coppa'', and ''salame'', but they are also considered good with cheeses, particularly [[Gorgonzola]] and [[Robiola]].

''[[Pisarei e faśö]]'' is a mixture of handmade [[pasta]] and borlotti beans.<!--Which kind of beans? Cannellini?--> This is served with a sauce made of tomato puree, extra virgin olive oil, onion, salt, and pepper. The dish typically is consumed with grated [[Parmigiano-Reggiano|Parmigiano]] on top.

Among the culinary specialties of the Piacenza region (although also enjoyed in nearby [[Cremona]]) is ''[[Mostarda|mostarda di frutta]]'', consisting of preserved fruits in a sugary syrup that is strongly flavored with mustard. ''Turtlìt'' (''tortelli dolci'' in standard Italian), or fruit dumplings, are filled with ''mostarda di frutta'', mashed [[chestnut]]s, and other ingredients, and they are served at Easter. ''Turtlìt'' are popular in the [[Ferrara]] area as well. ''Turtéi'', a similarly named Piacentine specialty, is a kind of pasta filled with spinaches and [[ricotta]] cheese, or filled with calabash. A similar Piacentine dish is the Panzerotti al Forno, which is made with pasta, ricotta cheese, and spinach.

Piacentine staple foods include corn (generally cooked as [[polenta]]) and rice (usually cooked as [[risotto]]), both of which are very common across northern Italy. Cheeses, such as [[Grana Padano]], are produced in Piacenza although nearby [[Parma]] is more famous for its dairy products.

The hills surrounding Piacenza are known for their vineyards. The wine produced in the area is qualified with a ''[[denominazione di origine controllata]]'' called "[[Colli Piacentini]]" ("Hills of Piacenza"). The main wines are ''[[Colli Piacentini|Gutturnio]]'' (red wines, both sparkling and still), ''Bonarda'' (a red wine, often sparkling and foamy, made from [[Croatina]] grapes), ''[[Ortrugo]]'' (a dry white wine), and ''[[Malvasia]]'' (a sweet white wine).<ref>{{cite web|title=Local Cuisine|publisher=Municipality of Piacenza|url=http://www.comune.piacenza.it/english/localcusine.asp|access-date=11 April 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828095547/http://www.comune.piacenza.it/english/localcusine.asp|archive-date=August 28, 2008}}</ref>
