Sea encroachment was a major problem for fishermen before the building of Groynes started in 2004. The groynes, put up over a length of 4&nbsp;km, vary in length from 165 to 300 metres each, with a height four meters above the mean sea level. As the years have passed, some acres have been reclaimed with the formation of a beach as predicted.

As of 2018, the Tiruvottiyur zone, along with the Tondiarpet zone, has a green cover of under 10 percent, below the city's 14.9 percent average. This was chiefly because of numerous industrial units, mills, power plants, refineries, fishing harbours, and docks.<ref name="Hindu_228CrProjectForGreen">{{cite news
