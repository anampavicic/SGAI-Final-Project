'''Agra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|ɡ|r|ə}} {{respell|AH|grə}}; {{IPA|hi|ˈaːɡɾaː|lang|Agra.ogg}}) is a city on the banks of the [[Yamuna]] river in the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], about {{convert|230|km|mi}} south-east of the national capital [[Delhi]] and 330&nbsp;km west of the state capital [[Lucknow]]. With a population of roughly 1.6 million, Agra is the fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh and [[List of cities in India by population|twenty-third most populous city]] in India.<ref name="CENSUS12">{{cite web|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/city.php|title=Cities in India with population more than 100,000|access-date=10 June 2016|publisher=Census2011|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120728184602/http://www.census2011.co.in/city.php|archive-date=28 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Agra's notable historical period began during [[Sikandar Lodi]]'s reign, but the golden age of the city began with the [[Mughals]] in the early 16th century. Agra was the foremost city of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the capital of the [[Mughal Empire]] under Mughal emperors [[Babur]], [[Humayun]], [[Akbar]], [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]]. Under Mughal rule, Agra became a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion, and saw the construction of the [[Agra Fort]], [[Sikandra, Agra|Sikandra]] and Agra's most prized monument, the [[Taj Mahal]], constructed between 1632 and 1648 by Shah Jahan in remembrance of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. With the decline of the Mughal empire in the late 18th century, the city fell successively first to [[Maratha Confederacy|Marathas]] and later to the [[East India Company]]. After Independence, Agra has developed into an industrial town, with a booming [[tourism]] industry, along with footwear, leather and other manufacturing. The Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort are [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]]. The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a [[monsoon]] season, and is famous for its Mughlai cuisine. Agra is included on the [[Golden Triangle (India)|Golden Triangle]] tourist circuit, along with [[Delhi]] and [[Jaipur]]; and the [[Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc]], a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with [[Lucknow]] and [[Varanasi]].

== Name ==<!--This entire subsection is fully referenced and relatively high quality. Other sections should follow suit.-->
The name Agra is explained by different derivations, all of which have low verifiability. The most accepted one is that it had its origin from the Hindi word ''agar'' meaning salt-pan, a name which was given to it because the soil in the region is brackish and salt used to be made here once by evaporation. Others derive it from Hindu History claiming that the [[Sanskrit]] word ''agra'' ({{Langx|sa|अग्र|label=none}}) which means the first of the many groves and little forests where [[Krishna]] frolicked with the ''gopis'' of [[Vrindavan]]. The term ''Agravana'' hence means grove forest.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mukerji|first=Satya Chandra|url=http://archive.org/details/travellersguidet00mukerich|title=The traveller's guide to Agra, containing an account of the past history, the antiquities, and the principal sights of Agra, together with some information about Agra as it is|date=1892|publisher=Delhi, Sen & Co.|others=University of California Libraries|pages=3}}</ref><ref name=":7"/>

Agra was also known as Akbarabad in the Mughal era.

== History ==<!--This entire subsection is fully referenced and relatively high quality. Other sections should follow suit.-->

=== Pre-Mughal era ===
Agra has two histories: one of the ancient city on the east, or left, bank of the river [[Yamuna]], going back so far as to be lost in the legends of [[Krishna]] and [[Mahabharata]] and reestablished by [[Sikandar Lodi|Sikandar Lodhi]] in 1504–1505; the other of the modern city, founded by [[Akbar]] in 1558, on the right bank of the river which is associated with the [[Mughals]], and known throughout the world as the city of the Taj. Of ancient Agra little now remains except  few traces of the foundations. It was a place of importance under various [[Hindu]] dynasties previous to the [[Muslim invasions of India]], but its history is unclear, and possess little historical interest.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|title=Part One: Babar|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/01babur.html#greatmoguls|url-status=live|access-date=3 April 2021|website=www.columbia.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208193519/http://www.columbia.edu:80/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/01babur.html |archive-date=8 February 2007 }}</ref> The 17th century chronicler named Abdullah said it was a village before the reign of Sikandar Lodi.

Agra's period of historical importance began during Sikandar Lodi's reign. In 1504–1505, Sultan Sikandar Lodi (reigned 1489–1517<ref name=":20">{{cite web|title=Lodī dynasty {{!}} Indian history|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lodi-dynasty|access-date=10 April 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>), the Afghan ruler of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], rebuilt Agra and made it the seat of government.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Bhanu|first=Dharma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CctFMm9HSH8C&pg=PP1|title=The Province of Agra: Its History and Administration|date=1979|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref> Sikandar Lodhi appointed a commission which inspected and surveyed both sides of the Yamuna from [[Delhi]] to [[Etawah]] and finally chose a place on the left bank, or the east side of the Yamuna, as the site for the city. Agra on the left bank of the Yamuna grew into a large flourishing town with royal presence, officials, merchants, scholars, theologians and artists. The city became one of the most important centres of Islamic learning in India. The sultan founded the village of [[Sikandra, Agra|Sikandra]] in the northern suburbs of the city and built there a ''[[Baradari (building)|Baradari]]'' of red sandstone in 1495, which was converted into a tomb by Jahangir, and now stands as the [[Tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani]], Akbar's empress.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bhanu|first=Dharma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CctFMm9HSH8C&pg=PP1|title=The Province of Agra: Its History and Administration|date=1979|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|pages=2–3|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Part Fourteen: Sikandra|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/14sikandra.html#maryam|url-status=live|access-date=4 April 2021|website=www.columbia.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304081535/http://www.columbia.edu:80/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/14sikandra.html |archive-date=4 March 2007 }}</ref>

After the Sultan's death in 1517, the city passed on to his son, Sultan [[Ibrahim Lodi]] (reigned 1517–26<ref name=":20" />). He ruled his sultanate from Agra until he was defeated and killed by Mughal Emperor [[Babur]] in the [[First battle of Panipat]], fought in 1526.<ref>{{cite web|title=01babur|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/01babur.html#babur|access-date=3 April 2021|website=www.columbia.edu}}</ref>

=== Mughal era ===
[[File:Town and port at agra.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Town and Fort of Agra, an engraving]]
The golden age of the city began with the [[Mughals]]. Agra was the foremost city of the subcontinent and the capital of the [[Mughal Empire]] until 1658, when [[Aurangzeb]] shifted the entire court to Delhi.<ref name=":11" />

[[Babur]] (reigned 1526–30<ref name=":19">{{cite web|title=Mughal dynasty {{!}} History, Map, Rulers, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mughal-dynasty|access-date=10 April 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>), the founder of the Mughal dynasty, acquired Agra after defeating the [[Lodi dynasty|Lodhis]] and the [[Tomaras of Gwalior]] in the [[First Battle of Panipat]] in 1526.<ref name=":19" /><ref name="auto1" /> Babur's connection with Agra began immediately after the battle of Panipat. He sent forward his son [[Humayun]], who occupied the town without opposition. The Raja of Gwalior, slain at Panipat, had left his family and the heads of his clan at Agra. In gratitude to Humayun, who treated them magnanimously, and protected them from plunder, they presented to him a quantity of jewels and precious stones as a token of homage. Among these was the famous diamond [[Koh-i-Noor|Koh-i-nur]].<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|title=Historical Introduction, Part One: Babar - Babar's connection with Agra|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/01babur.html#agra|access-date=3 April 2021|website=www.columbia.edu}}</ref> Babur went on to lay out the first formal Mughal garden in India, the [[Aram Bagh, Agra|Aram Bagh]] (or Garden of Relaxation) on the banks of the river Yamuna. Babur was determined to establish the seat of his government at Agra, but was almost dissuaded by the desolate appearance of the region, as clear from this quote from his memoir ''[[Baburnama]]'':<ref name="auto1" />

{{Blockquote|text=It always appears to me, that one of the chief defects of Hindustan is the want of artificial watercourses. I had intended, wherever I might fix my residence, to construct water-wheels, to produce an artificial stream, and to lay out an elegant and regularly planned pleasure ground. Shortly after coming to Agra I passed the Jumna with this object in view, and examined the country to pitch upon a fit spot for a garden. The whole was so ugly and detestable that I repassed the river quite repulsed and disgusted. In consequence of the want of beauty and of the disagreeable aspect of the country, I gave up my intention of making a ''charbagh'' (garden house); but as no better situation presented itself near Agra, I was finally compelled to make the best of this same spot.... In every corner I planted suitable gardens, in every garden I sowed roses and narcissus regularly, and in beds corresponding to each other. We were annoyed by three things in Hindustan; one was its heat, another the strong winds, and the third its dust. Baths were the means of removing all three inconveniences.|author=Babur|source=Baburnama}}

Very few vestiges remain of Babur's city, of his fruit and flower gardens, palaces, baths, tanks, wells and watercourses. The remnants of Babur's ''Charbagh'' can be seen today at [[Aram Bagh, Agra|Aram Bagh]], on the east side of Yamuna.<ref name="auto1"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Bhanu|first=Dharma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CctFMm9HSH8C&pg=PP1|title=The Province of Agra: Its History and Administration|date=1979|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|pages=4|language=en}}</ref> Babur was followed by his son Humayun (reigned 1530–40 and 1555–56<ref name=":19" />), but he was completely defeated at Kanauj in 1539, just nine years after his ascension, by [[Sher Shah Suri]], an Afghan nobleman, who had submitted to Babur, but revolted against his son. In this brief interruption in Mughal rule between 1540 and 1556, [[Sher Shah Suri]], established the short lived [[Sur Empire]], and the region was eventually reconquered by Akbar in the [[Second Battle of Panipat]] in 1556.

Under [[Akbar the Great|Akbar]] (reigned 1556–1605<ref name=":19" />), and followed by his grandson [[Shah Jahan]], Agra was immortalised in the history of the world. Akbar built the modern city of Agra on the right bank of Yamuna, where the majority of its part still lies. He converted the city into a great centre of political, cultural and economic importance, connecting it with the various parts of his vast empire. Akbar raised the towering ramparts of the Agra Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a new capital city of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], around 35&nbsp;km from Agra. The new capital city was later abandoned.<ref>{{cite web|title=Part Sixteen: Fatehpur Sikri|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/16fatahpursikri.html|url-status=live|access-date=14 September 2020|website=www.columbia.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208223315/http://www.columbia.edu:80/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/16fatahpursikri.html |archive-date=8 February 2007 }}</ref><ref name=":10">{{cite book|last=Bhanu|first=Dharma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CctFMm9HSH8C&pg=PP1|title=The Province of Agra: Its History and Administration|date=1979|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|pages=4–5|language=en}}</ref> Before his death, Agra had become probably one of the biggest cities in the east, with huge amounts of trade and commerce happening through its ''bazaars''.<ref name=":14">{{cite book|last=Mukerji|first=Satya Chandra|url=http://archive.org/details/travellersguidet00mukerich|title=The traveller's guide to Agra, containing an account of the past history, the antiquities, and the principal sights of Agra, together with some information about Agra as it is|date=1892|publisher=Delhi, Sen & Co.|others=University of California Libraries|pages=20–21}}</ref> The English traveller [[Ralph Fitch]] who visited Agra in September 1585 in the life-time of Akbar, writes about the town:<ref name=":10" />

{{Blockquote|text=Agra is a very great city, and populous, built with stone, having fair and large streets with a fair river running by it . . . . Agra and Fatehpur Sikri are two very great cities, either of them much greater than London, and very populous. Between Agra and Fatehpur are twelve miles ([[Kos (unit)|kos]] in reality) and all the way is a market of victuals and other things as full as though a man were still in a town, and so many people as if a man were in a market.}}

These impressions of Fitch are corroborated by another European traveller, [[William Finch (merchant)|William Finch]], who remarked about Agra:<ref name=":10" />

{{Blockquote|text=It is spacious, large, populous beyond measure, that you can hardly pass the street . . . .}}

Agra continued to expand and flourish during Akbar's successor [[Jahangir|Jahangir's]] reign as he wrote in his autobiography ''Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri'':<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":14" />

{{Blockquote|text=The habitable part of Agra extends on both sides of the river. On its west side, which has the greater population, its circumference is seven kos, and its breadth is one kos. The circumference of the inhabited part on the other side of the river, the side towards the east, is 2{{1/2}} kos, its length being one kos and its breadth half a kos. But in the number of its buildings it is equal to several cities of Iraq, Khurasan and Trans-Oxiana put together. Many persons have erected buildings of three or four storeys in it. The mass of the people is so great that moving about in the lanes and bazars is difficult.}}

Akbar's successor Jahangir (reigned 1605–27<ref name=":19" />) had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Siddiqi|first=Zeba|date=2006|title=City of Agra under the Mughal from 1526-1707|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/144510566.pdf|journal=Centre of Advance Study Department of History Augarh Muslim University Aligarh (India)|pages=10, 11}}</ref> Akbar's mausoleum at [[Sikandra, Agra|Sikandra]] was completed during Jahangir's reign. The [[Jahangiri Mahal]] in Agra fort and the tomb of [[Tomb of I'timād-ud-Daulah|Itmad-ud-daulah]] were also constructed during the reign of Jahangir. Jahangir loved Lahore and Kashmir more than Agra, but the latter continued to be the first city of the realm.<ref name=":11" /> It was, however, [[Shah Jahan]] (reigned 1628–58<ref name=":19" />) whose building activity raised Agra to the pinnacle of its glory. Shah Jahan, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Agra its most prized monument, the [[Taj Mahal]]. Built in loving memory of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]], the mausoleum was completed in 1653. The [[Jama Masjid, Agra|Jama Masjid]] and several other notable buildings like the [[Diwan-i-Am (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Am]], the [[Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Khas]], the [[Moti Masjid (Agra Fort)|Moti Masjid]], etc., inside the fort were planned and executed under his orders.<ref name=":11">{{cite book|last=Bhanu|first=Dharma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CctFMm9HSH8C&pg=PP1|title=The Province of Agra: Its History and Administration|date=1979|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|pages=1|language=en}}</ref>

Shah Jahan later shifted the capital to [[Shahjahanabad]] (now known as [[Delhi]]) in the year 1648,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=John F.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA119|title=The Mughal Empire|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521566032|language=en}}</ref> followed by his son [[Aurangzeb]] (reigned 1658–1707<ref name=":19" />) moving the entire court to Delhi in 1658. With this Agra began rapidly declining.

== Utilities ==
The electricity power distribution and bill collection in Agra is the  responsibility of [[Torrent Power]], a private sector company as well as DVVNL (Dakshinanchal Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited), a state owned entity of UPPCL. The control of power distribution in Agra was handed over to Torrent Power from the state-owned [[Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited|UP Power Corporation Ltd]] in 2010, in an effort to move towards power reforms and cutting the massive distribution losses in the state. This was the first time power distribution was privatised in Uttar Pradesh, except for [[Noida-Greater Noida Metro|Noida-Greater Noida]] falling under the [[National Capital Region (India)|NCR]].<ref>{{cite news|title=UPPCL to hand over Agra power network to Torrent Power|work=The Economic Times|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/uppcl-to-hand-over-agra-power-network-to-torrent-power/articleshow/5747905.cms?from=mdr|access-date=29 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Rawat|first=Virendra Singh|date=2 April 2010|title=Torrent Power begins power distribution in Agra|work=Business Standard India|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/torrent-power-begins-power-distribution-in-agra-110040200056_1.html|access-date=29 September 2020}}</ref>

===Taj Mahal===
{{main|Taj Mahal}}
{{Blockquote|text=The Taj Mahal rises above the banks of the river like a solitary tear suspended on the cheek of time.|author=[[Rabindranath Tagore]]|title=|source=(translated by Kshitish Roy) from One Hundred and One Poems by Rabindranath Tagore (pp. 95–96)}}

Taj Mahal is a mausoleum complex in Agra, built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb for his wife Mumtaz Mahal ("Chosen One of the Palace"), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the emperor's inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. India's most famed building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right) bank of the Yamuna River, about 1.6&nbsp;km east of the Agra Fort, also on the right bank of the Yamuna. The Taj Mahal is distinguished as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles. Other attractions include twin mosque buildings (placed symmetrically on either side of the mausoleum), pleasant gardens, and a museum. The complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983,<ref>{{cite web|title=UNESCO - World Heritage Site|url=https://www.tajmahal.gov.in/uneso-world-heritage-site.aspx|access-date=15 September 2020|website=www.tajmahal.gov.in}}</ref> and is one of the [[New Seven Wonders]] of the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Seven Wonders of the World|url=https://www.britannica.com/list/new-seven-wonders-of-the-world|access-date=15 September 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> The Taj Mahal is the most visited tourist spot in the India, attracting nearly 6.9 million visitors in 2018–19.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sharma|first=Aman|title=Tourists up at Taj Mahal and Red Fort but Qutub Minar loses its No.2 Spot|work=The Economic Times|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/tourists-up-at-taj-mahal-and-red-fort-but-qutub-minar-loses-its-no-2-spot/articleshow/70152555.cms|access-date=15 September 2020}}</ref><ref name=":18">{{cite web|title=Taj Mahal |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Taj-Mahal|access-date=7 April 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

The chief architect was probably the Persian architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori. Designed as a unified entity according to the principles of Mughal architecture, the five principal elements of the complex were the main gateway, garden, mosque, ''jawab'' (literally 'answer', a building mirroring the mosque), and the mausoleum, with its four minarets. The construction commenced in 1632 with upwards of twenty thousand workers from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe working to complete the mausoleum itself by 1639, the adjunct buildings by 1643, with decoration work continuing until at least 1647. In total, construction of the 42 acre (17 hectare) complex spanned 22 years.<ref name=":18" />

It can be observed from [[Agra Fort]] from where Emperor Shah Jahan gazed at it for the last eight years of his life, a prisoner of his son [[Aurangzeb]]. Verses of the Quran are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are 22 small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Taj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant and largest dome of the Taj Mahal has a diameter of {{convert|60|ft|m}}, and has a height of {{convert|80|ft|m}}; directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Shah Jahan's tomb was erected next to hers by his son Aurangzeb. The interiors are decorated with fine ''[[pietra dura]]'' inlay work, incorporating semi-precious stones.

However, air pollution caused by emissions from foundries and other nearby factories and exhaust from motor vehicles has damaged the Taj, notably its marble facade.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taj Mahal |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Taj-Mahal|access-date=15 September 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> A number of measures have been taken to reduce the threat to the monument, among them the closing of some foundries and the installation of pollution-control equipment at others, the creation of a parkland buffer zone around the complex, and the banning of nearby vehicular traffic, and more recently, use of 'mud pack' therapy.<ref>{{cite news|date=22 February 2020|first=Anuja |last=Jaiswal|title=Shah Jahan, Mumtaz graves undergo 'mud pack' therapy|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/agra-ahead-of-donald-trumps-visit-mumtaz-mahal-and-shahjahan-get-mudpacks-at-their-final-resting-place-for-ist-time-in-368-years/articleshow/74248512.cms|access-date=12 September 2020|work=The Times of India}}</ref> Perhaps most importantly, the {{cvt|10,400|km2}} [http://www.ttzagra.com Taj Trapezium Zone] has been created around the Taj Mahal and other nearby monuments where strict pollution restrictions are in place on industries, following a 1996 Supreme Court of India ruling.<ref>{{cite news|date=4 May 2008|title=Why is the Taj Trapezium Zone and why is it called so?|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Why-is-the-Taj-Trapezium-Zone-and-why-is-it-called-so/articleshow/3008537.cms|access-date=12 September 2020|work=The Times of India|language=en}}</ref>

===Agra Fort===
{{main|Agra Fort}}
The Agra Fort is a large 16th-century fortress of red sandstone located by the [[Yamuna river|Yamuna River]] in Agra. It was first established by the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] and served as the seat of royal government when Agra was the capital of the Mughal empire in addition to being a military base and a royal residence. Built on the site of earlier fortifications by [[Islam Shah Suri]]<ref name=":17">{{cite web|title=Part Eight: The Fort|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/08agrafort.html|url-status=live|access-date=6 April 2021|website=www.columbia.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210200336/http://www.columbia.edu:80/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/08agrafort.html |archive-date=10 February 2007 }}</ref>(son of [[Sher Shah Suri]]), the Agra Fort lies on the right bank of the Yamuna River and is connected to the [[Taj Mahal]] (downstream, around a bend in the Yamuna), by a stretch of parkland. The fort was commissioned by Akbar in 1565, taking around eight years to build.<ref name=":16" /> Though much of the structure of the fort was founded by Akbar, both the interior and exterior underwent considerable changes under his son [[Jahangir]] and grandson [[Shah Jahan]], who added many new structures, often of marble.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mukerji|first=Satya Chandra|url=http://archive.org/details/travellersguidet00mukerich|title=The traveller's guide to Agra, containing an account of the history, the antiquities, and the principal sights of Agra, together with some information about Agra as it is|date=1892|publisher=Delhi, Sen & Co.|others=University of California Libraries|pages=83}}</ref> The red sandstone walls of the roughly semi-circular structure<ref>{{cite web|title=Incredible India {{!}} Agra Fort|url=https://www.incredibleindia.org/content/incredibleindia/en/destinations/agra/agra-fort.html|access-date=7 April 2021|website=www.incredibleindia.org}}</ref> have a perimeter of about 2.5&nbsp;km, rise 21 metres high, and are surrounded by a moat.<ref name=":16" /> There are two entrances in the walls: the Delhi Gate facing west, the original entrance, situated nearly opposite to the Agra Fort railway station and Jama Masjid, and decorated with intricate marble inlays; and the Amar Singh Gate(also known as ''Hathi Pol<ref name=":17" />'', or Elephant Gate) facing south, presently the only means in or out of the fort complex).<ref name=":16" /> The complex of buildings in the fort—reminiscent of Persian and Timurid architecture,<ref name=":16" /> with great inspiration from Jain and Hindu architecture<ref name=":17" />—forms a city within a city.<ref name=":16">{{cite web|title=Agra Fort |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Agra-Fort|access-date=6 April 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

Among the major attractions in the fort is [[Jahangiri Mahal]], the largest residence in the complex, built by Akbar as a private palace for his [[Mariam-uz-Zamani|Rajput wives]]. In the Diwan-i-Am (Hall of Public Audience), the emperor would listen to public petitions and meet state officials. The Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience) was used for receiving distinguished visitors. The famous [[Peacock Throne]] was once kept there, before [[Aurangzeb]] took it to Delhi. Near the Diwan-i-Khas stands the [[Musamman Burj (Agra Fort)|Musamman Burj]], an octagonal Tower which was the residence of Shah Jahan's favourite empress, [[Mumtaz Mahal|Mumtaz Maḥal]]. The [[Moti Masjid (Agra Fort)|Moti Masjid]] (Pearl Mosque), constructed by Shah Jahan, is a structure made entirely of white marble. The emperor's private residence was the Khas Mahal, whose marble walls were once adorned with flowers depicted by precious gems. Located to its northeast is the Sheesh Mahal (Palace of Mirrors), its walls and ceilings inlaid with thousands of small mirrors.<ref name=":16" /> Numerous other structures are there in the complex, including the ''Anguri Bagh'', the ''Mina Bazaar'' etc.<ref name=":17" />

In addition to its other functions, the fort also served as a prison for Shah Jahan when Aurangzeb, his son and successor as emperor, had him confined there from 1658 until his death in 1666.<ref name=":16" />

===I'timād-ud-Daulah's tomb===
{{main|Tomb of I'timād-ud-Daulah}}
[[File:I'timād-ud-Daulah, Agra.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The I'timād-ud-Daulah's tomb]]
[[Nur Jehan|Nur Jahan]] commissioned [[Tomb of I'timād-ud-Daulah|I'timād-ud-Daulah's tomb]], sometimes called the "Baby Taj", for her father, [[Mirza Ghiyas Beg]], the Chief Minister of the Emperor [[Jahangir]]. Located on the left bank of the [[Yamuna]] river, the mausoleum is set in a large cruciform garden, crisscrossed by water courses and walkways. The area of the mausoleum itself is about {{Convert|23|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}, and is built on a base that is about {{Convert|50|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} and about {{convert|1|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} high. On each corner are hexagonal towers, about {{convert|13|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} tall. Small in comparison to many other Mughal-era tombs, it is sometimes described as a jewel box. Its garden layout and use of white marble, [[pietra dura]], inlay designs, and [[latticework]] presage many elements of the [[Taj Mahal]].

The walls are white marble from [[Rajasthan]] encrusted with semi-precious stone decorations – [[cornelian]], [[jasper]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[onyx]], and [[topaz]] in images of [[cypress]] trees and wine bottles or more elaborate decorations like cut fruit or vases containing bouquets. Light penetrates the interior through delicate [[Jali]] screens of intricately carved white marble.

=== Other places of Interest ===
Agra also has several other places of interest, most of them from its Mughal past. They include the Jama Masjid, Chini Ka Rauza, Aram Bagh, Mariam's Tomb, and Mehtab Bagh among others. The [[Jama Masjid (Agra)|Jama Masjid]] is a large mosque attributed to Shah Jahan's daughter [[Jahanara Begum]], built-in 1648, notable for its unusual dome and absence of minarets. The [[Chini Ka Rauza]], notable for its [[Persian architecture|Persian]] influenced dome of blue glazed tiles, is dedicated to the prime minister of Shah Jahan, Afzal Khan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Part Twelve: The Chînî-ka-Rauza|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/12chinikarauzah.html|url-status=live|access-date=16 September 2020|website=www.columbia.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301105623/http://www.columbia.edu:80/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/12chinikarauzah.html |archive-date=1 March 2008 }}</ref> The [[Aram Bagh, Agra|Aram Bagh]], commonly known as Ram Bagh today, is one of the oldest [[Mughal garden]] in India, and was built by the Mughal emperor [[Babur]] in 1528 on the bank of the Yamuna.<ref>{{cite web|title=Part Thirteen: The Ram Bagh|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/13rambagh.html|url-status=live|access-date=16 September 2020|website=www.columbia.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301105827/http://www.columbia.edu:80/itc/mealac/pritchett/00artlinks/agra_havell/13rambagh.html |archive-date=1 March 2008 }}</ref> It lies about {{convert|2.3|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the Taj Mahal.
