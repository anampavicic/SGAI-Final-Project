=== Climate ===
Ipiales features an unusually cool [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb''), with an average temperature around {{convert|15|C-change|F-change|disp=or}} cooler than its near equatorial climate might suggest, due to the city's high altitude of almost {{convert|3000|m}} above sea level, which makes it the highest major city in Colombia and one of the highest on Earth. The average temperature is cold for a subtropical highland climate with the city escaping an ''ETH'' ([[alpine climate|alpine]]) classification by less than {{convert|1.5|C-change|F-change|disp=or}}. Temperatures rarely break the {{convert|20|°C}} mark or fall below freezing, giving the city perpetual spring-like weather. Ipiales has a rainier season from October to May and a drier season from June through September. Rainfall is frequent though not heavy year round, falling on an average of 235 days for an annual total of approximately {{convert|925|mm|in|0|disp=or}}.
