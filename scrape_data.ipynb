The [[Presidential Palace, Tirana|Palace of Brigades]], the ministries buildings, the government building and the municipality hall are designed by Florestano Di Fausto and Armando Brasini, both well-known architects of the Mussolini period in Italy.

The Royal Palace or Palace of Brigades previously served as the official residence of King Zog I. It has been used by different Albanian governments for various purposes. Because of the outbreak of World War II, and the 1939 [[Italian invasion of Albania]], Zog I fled Albania and never had a chance to see the Palace fully constructed. The Italians finished it and used it as the Army Headquarters. The Palace took its nickname Palace of Brigades because it was taken from the Italians by a people\\'s army brigade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atrium-see.eu/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=154:municipality-of-tirana-partner-in-a-transnational-project-on-totalitarian-architecture |title=Municipality of Tirana, partner in a transnational project on totalitarian architecture |website=atrium-see.eu |access-date=25 October 2016 |archive-date=25 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025235841/http://www.atrium-see.eu/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=154:municipality-of-tirana-partner-in-a-transnational-project-on-totalitarian-architecture |url-status=dead}}</ref>\\n\\nIn the 21st century, Tirana turned into a proper modernist city, with large blocks of flats, modern new buildings, new shopping centres and many green spaces.

The [[Presidential Palace, Tirana|Palace of Brigades]], the ministries buildings, the government building and the municipality hall are designed by Florestano Di Fausto and Armando Brasini, both well-known architects of the Mussolini period in Italy.

The Royal Palace or Palace of Brigades previously served as the official residence of King Zog I. It has been used by different Albanian governments for various purposes. Because of the outbreak of World War II, and the 1939 [[Italian invasion of Albania]], Zog I fled Albania and never had a chance to see the Palace fully constructed. The Italians finished it and used it as the Army Headquarters. The Palace took its nickname Palace of Brigades because it was taken from the Italians by a people\\'s army brigade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atrium-see.eu/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=154:municipality-of-tirana-partner-in-a-transnational-project-on-totalitarian-architecture |title=Municipality of Tirana, partner in a transnational project on totalitarian architecture |website=atrium-see.eu |access-date=25 October 2016 |archive-date=25 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025235841/http://www.atrium-see.eu/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=154:municipality-of-tirana-partner-in-a-transnational-project-on-totalitarian-architecture |url-status=dead}}</ref>\\n\\nIn the 21st century, Tirana turned into a proper modernist city, with large blocks of flats, modern new buildings, new shopping centres and many green spaces.
